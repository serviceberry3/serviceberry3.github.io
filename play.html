          <p>I'm taking an old Royal Safari typewriter and digitizing it by adding an array of buttons on the underside of the machine.
             When a key is pressed, it will hit a button that triggers a specific voltage input for an Arduino (Elegoo, actually) Nano. 
             The letter will appear on an LCD dislay, and it will look like the typewriter is "stamping" the display. An interface will 
             be created allowing the user to create files on an SD card and write text, and also pan around within the file. The carriage
             is controlled via I2C connection to an NXT brick and two old NXT servos I had, which turn two spools of fishing line.
            An end goal is to convert the entire thing into either a standard USB keyboard or a bluetooth keyboard.</p>

          <p>Robert T. Builder was a once-neglected childhood plush toy who came to popularity in the late 2010s. He was 
            loved by exchange students, Yale students, and <a href="https://www.nchs.cc" class="underline">North Central High 
              School</a> students alike. Best known for his love 
            of hot tubs, travel, and laid-back party hosting, he was misplaced in a warehouse in 2020. Come home, Bob. We miss you.</p>

          <p>Have you noticed that read receipts are mandatory on Facebook Messenger? I believe texting should be a low-stakes, pressure-free activity, so I'm working
            on a workaround (ha) to avoid sending read receipts. It was previously possible by <a href="https://github.com/raphaelrk/messenger-lowkey">simply blocking 
              a few HTTP requests from Facebook's servers, but that no longer works...</a>
