    I currently study at Yale and do research with the <a href=
    "http://yecl.org" class="underline">Yale Efficient Computing Lab</a> under 
    <a href="http://www.linzhong.org" class="underline">Professor Lin Zhong, Ph.D.</a>, to develop integration techniques for cell phones and flying drones in order to realize mobile hands-free computing experiences.

    At YECL, I've researched and developed on-screen text stabilization techniques, harnessed OpenCV and pre-trained neural networks to create a computer vision system that follows a human user, written FreeRTOS-based quadcopter firmware, and set up a pipeline for controlling the drone via the onboard smartphone and its camera.

    In summer 2022, I interned at The Aerospace Corporation as a Small Satellite Embedded Software Developer. I programmed a microcontroller for an early-stage CubeSat project as part of Aerospace's AeroCube small satellite fleet. I ported microROS to
    their radiation-tolerant board and interfaced the board with peripheral computers.
