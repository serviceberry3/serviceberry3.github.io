The coffee processing is similar to cacao. First, they have an awesome machine that removes the outermost shell. It was originally a manually operated crank but they rigged a small gas motor to turn it super fast. Then the shelled coffee sits and ferments in a tub for 36 hours, so that the grains absorb the sweet coating left by the outer shells. After that, the grains are dried in the sun for a day or two, or dried on screens inside that hang from the roof. The indoor drying takes way longer, like a month or more, but they do that so that the geese and other animals don't poop all over it. The indoor-dried grains are reserved for top buyers, while the rest get sold in Huaquillo, Tamborapa, or, as Víctor likes to joke, to the Chileans. According to Víctor the Chileans and Ecuadorans do actually buy the poorer grains and even just the inner shells because they're cheaper. Also Víctor said cheap powdered coffee in the US and elsewhere is usually made from just the inner shells, just like low-quality chocolate is made from just the cacao shells. Once the grains are dried, the second shell is removed by hand and then the coffee is ready to be sold or roasted. Another interesting thing Is that there are some grains that are perfectly cylindrical. Usually each grain separates into two perfect half cylinders, but the special ones are one cylinder and can't separate. Apparently a little while ago that was also considered trash or Chilean-worthy, but recently there was some culinary development in the boujie cafés of the world, and now those odd grains can be sold to the right buyer for big money. But Víctor still discards them because people here don't like to buy them. 

Víctor actually has one regular buyer in Austria. It's a previous WWOOFer who buys a bunch of his coffee and distributes it to his family and friends. Víctor takes it to Piura where Giancarlos lives, and then Giancarlos ships it via air to Austria. Somehow the shipping company figured out they were shipping coffee for sales, and then they made Víctor register for a biosecurity seal, which took like two years or something crazy. The coffee had to be tested in a lab and stuff. Now he has to get special labels printed and seal the coffee in packages and everything, a process which we went through a couple nights ago. He has a kitchen scale for weighing it and even has a heat sealing machine. The label is also very cool, the Austrian designed it. I helped grind the roasted coffee for bagging. Easier to grind than cacao.

The meals here are huge, and Elsi does all the cooking and dishes. Usually breakfast is a giant bowl of rice topped with omelette, boiled bananas, cabbage, yucca, or potato. Carbs on carbs. The sheer quantity of rice that they eat and serve me is insane. Once at breakfast we also had some cow pancreas (sweetbreads, I guess), which was interesting. It was very rich. They said they eat almost all parts of the cow. Including the tongue, I confirmed. Lunch is always a soup with some beans or legumes and fideos (noodles), sometimes with some meat in it. Dinner is often the carbiest of all the meals. A huge bowl of oca or tortillas (they're small, thick, and fried) with a piece of homemade cheese. Sometimes potato, I think. There's a weird type of vegetable here that's sort of a potato but creamier. Sometimes with breakfast or dinner we also have some chopped red onion. At breakfast usually we have hot avena (oats) tea. With lunch its usually a pineapple or cocona water, and with dinner sometimes a very watered down and sweetened coffee, or just plain water, or hot milk. I started putting coffee in the avena every morning because it's delicious, and no one had ever done that before but now Víctor has adopted it and loves it. One night we also had arroz con leche and I advised Víctor to add coffee, which he also loved. It's crazy that they've never tried these things before, with the coffee essence always on the table.

Tonight we actually ate cuy (Guinea pig), it was my first time trying it because I'd tragically missed it in Choqueqirao on the third day when  I went ahead on the trail. The cuy we ate had been their pet :'( The meat tastes and looks almost exactly like chicken. I don't know how I felt about the little claws in there though. But at least I got try one of Peru's most popular delicassies.

In this region of Perú they even use some different words, the most obscure of which seems to be kión (ginger). They had never even heard the word jengibre until a WWOOFer used it. Also calling pasta fideo or tallarines is weird, I've never heard those. They used jengibre and pasta in Abancay. I also just learned that toilet is wáter in Perú instead of inodoro. And cake is keke up here :) 

A few days ago the power went out and it was out for two days. At least the water doesn't cut out whenever it rains, like it did in Tupac. Apparently every time it rains there the river goes crazy and a bunch of debris blocks some pipe. Anyway, they just recently got power here, so it's normal for them. They said it might have gone out because of the earthquake centered here that hit a few days before I arrived. At this point I'm just chasing the quakes. Yesterday there was a pretty big one centered closer to Piura. We were picking coffee and I didn't feel anything, but Felipe apparently did, and Elsi was in the house and everything shook. It turned out it was pretty bad in Piura, at least 1000 houses were wrecked and some 30 ppl were wounded, no one died though. A lot of fissures opened up in the ground. A little bit of the doorway fell in the room I'm staying in. The quake that happened the week before I came was apparently much scarier, but the house wasn't damaged at all. Víctor told me that 2 years ago there was a big earthquake here at around 1 am, which was pretty scary. Everything shook for about 5 minutes. It had been hard because everything was dark, so it was hard to find the kids and make sure everyone was safe. 

Anyway, Tamborapa Pueblo had their power restored fast, while Huaquillo was without for a long time. Interestingly Víctor and his fam still haven't even started paying for their power, because the guy hasn't come to check their meter. And Vladi told me that in order for the power to be restored this technician who lived up on a mountain had to come check it out, which was funny. Also they seem to refer to all electricity in general as luz (light), which is also funny. Like "that blender won't work without light." 

I've gotten fast at picking coffee, Víctor seems to be really impressed. I play music while we pick. Today we finished the main coffee orchard. They work every Saturday and said I could take the day off, so I worked fewer hours than usual. 

One of the neighbors comes sometimes to help pick coffee and she eats with us, sometimes she brings her kids. Víctor says he goes to help out on her farm sometimes in exchange. That's a big thing in Perú. The neighbor and her whole family actually came for dinner the night I arrived. Anyway, the neighbor (Maria) has this insanely old-looking cell phone. It's a big keypad with a small screen and has a flashlight on the top. She said she bought it in 2017. I told her it has to be from the 90s. 

Elsi and Víctor, like pretty much everyone I've met in Perú, don't really care about COVID. They sort of brush it off, even when I said Perú supposedly has the highest mortality rate in the world they were like at least we're winning in something. Both of them believe in God, Elsi believes everything in life is predetermined, so if she's gonna die from COVID it was already set in stone long ago. No wonder she's hosting me. COVID also hasn't really done much to this área it seems, although Elsi did say there were three or four deaths in Tamborapa Pueblo, which relative to its size seems like a lot to me. She also said her siblings (she has 8, 2 of whom live in TP) never wore masks, and they've been fine, so she's not scared. She is, however, scared of the vaccine, and won't take it. She thinks it's too experimental and dangerous. Also people here don't seem to be big fans of China, and the vaccine available here is Chinese. Elsi said she'd heard the Chinese were putting snake venom in their vaccine. Víctor doesn't believe in predetermination and will take the vaccine, although it's still not available to his age group in Cajamarca. 

When we work sometimes Víctor tells me stories or jokes. There was one that he said is a true story, in which, to avoid being drafted into the military, a Peruvian man cut off his testicles, thinking then he wasn't a man anymore and couldn't be drafted. I think he did avoid the draft because he was severely wounded, but then everyone joked that he was actually the manliest of all for having the willpower to cut off his testicles. Víctor also told me about some Peruvian war heroes from the War of the Pacific, like one suicide bomber, and one who had rode his horse off a cliff instead of being captured by the Chilean army. The suicide pilot had been wearing a fancy watch made by some famous watchmaker, I forget who, and to this day it's on display in a museum in Chile. The repair manual burned a long time ago in some library, and the watch is insanely complex, so will never be fixed. Chile also captured a Peruvian naval ship during the war, and was supposed to give it back according to the treaty along with the Tacna province, but the ship remains in Chile's hands as a museum.

One night after dinner I talked to Víctor alone for a long time after dinner. The most interesting tidbits were that for some reason he had thought there were no homeless people in the US, that he thought China had created COVID to try to wipe out all other nations of the world, and that the drivers who went to Tamborapa Pueblo from Jaén were extremely skilled and that the reason their eyes were red was because they often did two out-and-back trips per day, each 8 hours. Often they would do one trip that left around 5 am, and one left late afternoon, so they wouldn't get home until like midnight and wouldn't get much sleep. Víctor said accidents would only happen if some drivers didn't know the road well. I also explained the electoral college to Víctor, which he thought was interesting.

Apparently the dog isn't named Doggy, but Doki. Come on though. The kids love to carry the dogs around like babies and cradle them or make them dance. Doki always makes a funny moaning noise when he's in their lap.

I forgot to mention that during my first morning here, Víctor slaughtered a long-tailed weasel that had made It's home under a pile of wood. It was pretty amazing, he stabbed it with a machete through the wood pile even while it was scurrying around. There was another one in there that escaped, although I tried to hit it with a log. Those weasels, Victor said, solely ate blood, and easily killed chickens. They were even capable of killing a bull by biting it in the neck and slowly draining it's blood. He was proud of the dead weasel, who's bloody eyeball was popping out of its face. 

For some reason Víctor thinks a lot of the things I say are the funniest things ever. I think it's partially because of the slang I use. 

After every meal Víctor says "gracias amor, gracias a dios, gracias con todos" which I guess means thanks my love, thank you God, thanks everyone. I've been meaning to ask why it's "con todos" instead of "a todos." 

Víctor and Elsi seem pretty supportive of Pedro Castillo, the new leftist president of Perú, partially because he's the first president who's a farmer, and he's from a small village in Cajamarca. They also said he seemed to show the least signs of wanting to be president for corrupt/power-hungry reasons. We watched his inauguration and some other ceremonies/speeches he did (one in a city near Abancay) on the news. 

The kids are currently on a 2-week school vacation break, and the main summer vacation is Dec/Jan/Feb. There's one teacher in Huaquillo who is taking advantage of the pandemic to not teach and instead drink himself to oblivion. He apparently sends some learning materials sometimes. The teachers in Tamborapa Pueblo do a better job, but it sounds like Castillo thinks Perú won't return to more normal in-person learning until at least 2022. 

Tonight after dinner Víctor and Elsi were peeling some achiote, which is that tree with red fruit and a strong red pigment that Jose and Nelli had. Here they take out all the seeds and soak them to extract all the pigment, then mix it with garlic to make a paste that will color their food. I still don't really get the point of that :0 They were also cutting up what they said were figs, but they need to be cooked because otherwise the skin emits a white paste that's extremely acidic.

Below is a pic of me and Felipe when we went to deliver a keke to Maria, the neighbor.
