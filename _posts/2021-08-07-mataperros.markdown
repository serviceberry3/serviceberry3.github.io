Currently on my way to Piura, my final destination which is in the desert. It's pretty crazy because I'm not very far from Piura, yet the climate there is vastly different. Here it's been in the 60s and rainy all week, and there it's sunny and gets up to about 90 every day. I'm going to a small farm outside of the city that Giancarlos' family owns. Tonight I'm staying at Giancarlos' apartment.

On Sunday we went with some neighbors to an amazing three-story waterfall (it pools in three places). It was so tall that I couldn't even see where it ended at the top. The hike to get there was about an hour, and probably the most technically difficult hike I've done because it was all a mudslide, and I was wearing flip flops. We basically just hiked up a river/the riverbank. The hike had some great views of the clouds and mountains, and also was very green, luscious, and rainforesty. In some seasons you can climb up the waterfall to the top section, but they said it was too slippery now. It started raining while we were at the falls, but it was a nice light mist, so it just blended in with the mist coming off the waterfall. It rarely rains hard here; usually it's light and doesn't last very long. 

After the hike we had a late lunch and then relaxed. Victor told me about some interesting stuff, though. First of all, I learned that he leaves the outer red shell on some of the coffee while it dries, which he says gives it a stronger flavor. 

Also, part of the reason why he dries some of the coffee inside is because people come to try to steal it. He said there were a few people from a village between Huancabamba and Tamborapa who couldn't find work and had taken to robbing farms in the area when they knew the owners were gone. They would only steal a little when they came. And apparently Víctor's brother-in-law is very malicious and also used to come steal coffee from Víctor. Luckily Víctor used to have very smart dogs who protected his property well, once Víctor had come home to find a ripped sleeve on the lawn and had figured out from the neighbors that a robber had been there. One of the dogs had also been able to smell gringos really well and had gone down to Huaquillo (the village) alone when some WWOOFers had arrived and Víctor wasn't home (at that time there hadn't been any way to communicate with the WWOOFers to coordinate their arrival). The dog brought the WWOOFers to the farm and then started playing soccer with them :) Unfortunately thieves kept poisoning Víctor's good dogs, and his brother-in-law even poisoned one. He ended up also poisoning his own dog when it accidentally ate the food he'd set out. I doubt he cared. It also took a really long time for Víctor's dog to die, they kept trying to give it remedies to save it :'( Luckily, though, word had gotten out that Víctor's dogs would wreak havoc on any thieves, so people don't usually dare to rob him anymore, even though the dogs he has now are small and dumb. Anyway, in Perú, mataperros means hooligan or delinquent, which seemed odd at first, but now I understand.

Then Víctor told me about the Ronda, which is an improvised form of government in rural areas of Perú. It's a group of people from a village, usually with several subgroups and leaders. They meet and deal out justice whenever someone commits a crime. For example, when they catch someone who robbed a farm, they meet and decide what the punishment should be. Usually it's a few days or a week of forced labor, during which the accused is pretty much not allowed to sleep and forced to do exercises or other chores during the night. It's enforced via whipping. The ronda sends one person to supervise each day. The rondas were apparently big in Peru back in the day when there were a lot of terrorist groups trying to take control in the countryside. The terrorists would be armed with heavy-duty rifles but were usually solo, and ronderos would corner and surround them from far away, then starve them out. Víctor said the ronderos would only carry whips, but the terrorists didn't know that because they were too far away. The Peruvian government supported the ronderos strongly for their struggle against the terrorists, and offered to provide them with automatic weapons, but they refused. Instead they asked the government to provide them with more farming tools.

Pedro Castillo, the new president of Perú, is historic because he's the first rondero / farmer to become president. He wants to incorporate the rondas into the Peruvian constitution and legal system. He also wants to reform the Peruvian press and TV, Víctor says TV channels aren't regulated much and often help corrupt young people. 

Some days ago he'd told me that the Peruvian government was really lacking in resources/support for farmers and essentially didn't help them at all, whereas the Colombian government had created programs to give developing farmers monthly payments and supplies. He said in Ecuador there was also a lot of support, including leniant loan payment periods and even TV channels dedicated to agriculture education. 

In Perú there are several privately-owned farmers' coalitions, the goal being to help provide farmers with more knowledge AMD to help keep prices stable and offer the farmers better prices than they'd find in their small villages. The coalitions are usually run by one or a couple of people from the city. So Víctor had tried joining like three or four different ones. They always offered better prices and said they would be sending delegates to help teach about how to cultivate coffee more successfully. But every single one turned out to be a scam. The owners would always sell buy up the coffee from the farmers at a low price and sell it for a lot in the cities or globally, and they'd keep all of the profits. Or sometimes they'd promise a dividend return per sack of coffee at a later date, but then it would be less than originally promised or they would make Víctor go to a nearby city to collect it, which cost way more than it was worth. Sometimes the coalitions would send delegates to make sure all of the farmers were progressing well and were satisfied with their production, but they'd rig it so that the delegates only visited the most successful farms. Plus there was usually a fee to join the coalitions. So overall they were robbing all of the farmers blind and getting rich. 

Luckily Víctor learned a lot about how to refine his coffee production through some volunteers who came. Some actual coffee tasters from Europe had apparently come through South America tasting coffee and volunteering on the farms. Víctor said they were the ones who first told him to ferment the coffee, and then he'd experiment with the length of fermentation to get it just right. The tasters had said the best coffee they'd found in South America was in San Ignacio, just north of where Víctor lives.

Victor says there are five factors of coffee taste and quality: aroma, flavor, acidity, weight, body. And the different types of coffee usually have some qualities but not others, so he usually blends them in the batches he sells.

One of the neighbors' uncles passed away from COVID this past weekend, which was sad. He had been in the hospital for two months and was only 45. There's no hospital in Tamborapa Pueblo, only a health center. Most kids are born in their houses.

We fully finished this round of harvest yesterday. While we were working Víctor found this crazy worm on one of the coffee plants, which is called shanga cuya, cuya meaning guinea-pig-like, not to be confused with cuya meaning "whose." :0 The worms have a coat of long yellow and white spikes all over their bodies, and almost look like a little porcupine or just some kind of plant. They're extremely venemous, and if you touch one you'll be in pain for at least an hour. The pain apparently spreads some throughout your body, too. Victor's daughter Ariana once picked one up when she was younger because she had mistaken it for a chick. I've been trying to find the English name of shanga cuya online, with no luck. I'm guessing it's some kind of moth or caterpillar.

Octa recently informed us that he found a 650-gram solid gold penant at Choqueqirao using a metal detector. It was buried half a meter. He also found a bunch of other objects made of silver. So I guess he's rich now. He wants to open a museum, but I'm guessing that wouldn't go over too well with the Peruvian government. He always goes to Choqueqirao and Machu Picchu in the middle of the night so that he can avoid paying, and this time he went treasure hunting. He claims that he can also feel an energy in his body when he's near the objects, as if he has some kind of internal scanner. Anyway, if the penant is actually solid gold, which seems likely, it's probably worth millions. Also the ancientness. The question is who should those objects actually belong to? No one, I would say. But they have already been claimed, legally speaking. 

My last night in Huaquillo Víctor gave me three 250-gram bags of roasted coffee, which was generous because he usually charges 15 soles per bag. In exchange I gave him a bottle of maple syrup, which he and the family tasted and enjoyed. Víctor is pretty sure the coffee will make it through customs because of his special seal, but I have my doubts. Strong doubts. It's really gonna suck when they throw my coffee into their giant garbage disposal/pureeing machine without even looking closely at the label. Víctor keeps telling me that the European WWOOFers have taken tons of coffee through the airport, but the US is different, I tell him. Anyway, in case it does make it through, I asked Victor for another bag and we filled it with José's cacao, so that the cacao appears to be the same coffee. I'm guessing the cacao is similar enough to coffee to pass a chemical test.

On Monday we finished the harvest early, so Victor took me up to the very top of the coffee hill, which is further than it looks, and harder to climb than it looks. At the top there are a bunch of power line poles. The power line rigs at Huaquillo are pretty crazy, they often connect the tops of the hills, so at the house when you look up there's a line like 100 feet in the sky. It would make an amazing zip line. The view from the top of the hill was incredible. Víctor pointed out where the neighbors lived and said it had been easy to isolate when the pandemic first hit. The area had also taken it really seriously, no one ever went out except to buy food, and when they returned they would take a bleach shower.

The food at Huaquillo was overall really good. We did have salted mackerel twice. It comes from the coast and the salt makes it last like 4-5 days before it goes bad, so it can be shipped easily. Elsi would soak it for a day before to get the salt out, but it was still really salty when we ate it. We also sometimes had fresh cucumber and once they killed a chicken to eat. Some onions too. Other than that it was boiled green bananas, rice, potatoes, pasta, beans, soup, and homemade cheese. On the wall inside the house one of the kids had written out a recipe for this dish that includes salted mackerel, boiled bananas, and chopped onion, and I told them it was dumb that step 5 said to soak the fish a day before, but by the time you got there, it was too late. They thought that was really funny.

One of the pet geese is really agressive and always tried to bite me when I walk past a certain area. For some reason its always the same area, he'll see me from even far away and run across the lawn to get me.

I asked Víctor what the word chueca meant, because I was thoroughly confused. The dictionary said the primary definition was a bone, but that seemed odd. He said technically it should be a bone, but it actually means "crooked" or "twisted" here. It can also mean gay, which makes sense because there's a neighborhood in Madrid called Chueco where a lot of gay people live. Then we talked about the word Lima, which has three meanings: a file (tool), the capital of Peru, and lime.

I think I mentioned this in an earlier blog, but in Abancay it was common slang to put words backwards, like ñoba (baño), mosva (vamos), fercho (chofer), rrope (perro). Víctors family hadn't really heard of that and thought it was funny. José and Nelli also weren't familiar with it. So maybe it's only a thing in the South.

I asked Víctor why he always says gracias con todos instead of gracias a todos, and he had no idea, but said it probably should be gracias a todos.


It turns out Gata's full name is actually Agatha Cristlay, which is wild. Agatha Christie.

Ariana, the youngest of the kids, talks almost only in "itos." In Spanish it's common to add "ito" and "cito" to the ends of words to make them more endearing and informal. But Ariana uses those excessively, like even mas abajito (a little further down), and mas allacito (a little further that way), and a ton of others. My favorite is cuycito (guinea pig). Un solcito (one Peruvian Sol) is also a keeper. 

Víctor told me some about the war between Ecuador and Perú, during which Ecuador apparently received aid from Israeli pilots, which ended up being a failure. The Israelí pilots didn't know how to dodge giant Peruvian mountains and a lot crashed. Perú also had an edge because the Ecuadorians had planted mines in the rainforest, and the natives got really mad and started guerilla bands using just their spears. Peru also got some missiles from other countries, which helped them out, although a lot of the missiles turned out to be defective. In the end Perú won, otherwise Huaquillo would be located in Ecuador (it's close to the border).

Víctor also told me that Noah from the bible is Noé in Spanish. Yeah, a lot of people in Perú have had trouble pronouncing and understanding my name.

Víctor is very anti-Chinese, as seen...he says the Chinese are filling the world with junk and that all the equipment they make is trash, like some weed whackers he got that lasted a couple hours. He says the Brazilian-made stuff is pretty good, and of course Japanese and German are the best. I've noticed that a lot of the motorcycles here are Honda, but he said that Honda started a separate branch in Brazil which is of lesser quality.

I've seen some nice insects at Huaquillo. In my room I caught a little scorpion in my water bottle. I thought it was a baby or something, but Víctor said there are only small scorpions around. Anyway, I kept it as my pet for a day or two, but then I didn't know what to feed it, so as directed by the Galvez fam, I tried to feed it to the chickens. They ended up not seeing it and then Gatha pureed it with her foot.

I also saw a big and interesting spider in my room, and a bat! There seemed to be one resident fellow bat that lived in the roof of both the place I stayed in Tupac and in Huaquillo. I don't like that because they flap around so much. But after a certain time they would always quiet down. I also learned from Nelli that bat contains all of the vowels. Murciélago. Also eucalipto. 

All of my hosts have wanted me to send them my music playlist. I have a lot of regaton songs. One day while we were harvesting, I played the song Gasolina by Daddy Yankee, and Víctor said "A ella le gusta la gasolina" refers to women who are into chofers (drivers). But I'm pretty sure that's not it. It's funny though, because everyone in the US always talks about what the meaning might be. It seems as though Daddy Yankee purposefully left it a mystery. 

On Tuesday around 530 am, in the dark, a car going to Huancabamba came to pick me and Elsi up. We drove to Tamborapa, where we stopped for a while, and I saw two of the drivers from Jaén, including the one who had driven me. There eyes didn't seem to be as red, which was good. The ride from TP to Huancabamba was bumpy and windy as usual, and Elsi was vomiting the whole time. There had been someone vomiting the whole time on my ride from Jaén, too. Bumpy. Windy. Elsi really hasn't traveled at all, and I think motion sickness is part of the reason why. She hadn't ever even been to Piura, only to Huancabamba 10 years ago to renew her DNI and credit card, which she was doing again on Tue. So I caught her at an extremely special time. It seemed crazy that she had to pay the 60 soles round trip, which is a lot for them, just to renew the ID, and she said she might even try to come back that same night. Also I met her daughter from a different man, who accompanied her to Huancabamba. I also was responsible for shipping a giant sack of sweet lemons, achiote, and some bananas and maybe something else to Giancarlos. I told Elsi about Agatha Christie. As usual the driver stopped in a village along the way to eat breakfast, and some of the passengers ate too. Elsi bought me a bag of banana chips and toasted corn. 

I forgot to mention in previous blogs that most of the highways I rode on in Perú have little streams or rivers that run right over them, which slows down travel even more. On the way to Huancabamba we hit a pretty deep one that I probably wouldn't have driven through. The driver stopped and thought about it for a few minutes. There was also a little makeshift bridge bypass for motorcycles but it wouldn't have held our weight. Finally he went for it, and it turned out fine. But if we had lost traction with the road I thought the river would have swept us away to this little waterfall next to the road. 
There's "highway" from Huancabamba to Piura, but not really for the first part. They're still working on it. But once we descended down from the mountains to the desert, there was fully paved road. Also very straight and flat. It made me feel like I was almost back in Indiana again. I loved the desert, which I'll talk more about in the next post.

Also, my last night in Huaquillo I finally finished the chapter book I bought in Spain. I have another one that I'm starting. I learned a lot of vocab from the book and made a ton of flashcards, but the vocab was a) very proper Spain Spanish, and b) a lot of it was irrelevant to daily conversation because the book was about a mythical/medieval world. I definitely learn more useful vocab and slang just from conversations with my hosts.<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG-20210802-WA0006.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
