On Thursday we helped sweep and clean the lowest level of the treehouse. We also went to a nearby property supposedly owned by a utility company to get some wood, and then we rebuilt a bridge across the ditch/sewer that stands between the treehouse and the road. The bridge had broken due to flooding a while ago. We are continuing to build the terrace and are using some more windshields and tires that Octa found/was given to build walls for the garden beds. We already planted a bunch of avocado pits and are about to plant some seeds that I brought on top of the avocadoes. (They'll be transplanted later apparently.) Usually while we work we talk to Octa about American culture, Peruvian slang, stories, his experiences, etc.
Friday evening I went with Octa further uphill to a large property from which he "steals" a bunch of herbs: anise, eucalyptus,  and others. He brings them back and plants the seeds in the treehouse garden. He told me some interesting things while we were there, like that he doesn't believe COVID exists, that people die from COVID because they think they have COVID and it psychs them out. He equated it to some research experiment he had read about where the subject is tied down to a table such that they can't see what's going on and their wrists are cut just slightly, away from the vein. Then a tube is placed near their wrists such that it feels like they're gushing blood. They're left alone and after a while many die of a heart attack because they panic thinking they're about to die.
While we were collecting herbs at dusk, Octa also told me that he believes in some kind of life before and death where we can communicate with each other. He said, "It would be hypocritical for me to think that my energy didn't exist hundreds of years ago and won't exist forever." He also told me that when the pandemic hit, hundreds of people had walked from Lima to join their families in Abancay/Apurimac, and some people in Abancay had acted like the end of the world was coming because they thought all of the relatives would bring COVID.
On Friday night, some middle-aged women came to the bar because they had heard about it. They talked to us a lot about what we were doing in Peru and about their kids, etc. One of them had had one son, but he had been murdered. After he died, she was devastated and slowly developed epilepsy, which she still had, but she was a lot better now and said she healed herself with CBD and medical marijuana. She was able to get up to the third level of the treehouse, which was awesome. One of the ladies asked us about voting in the US and how the votes are counted. Voting here is mandatory and failure to vote results in a fine. Another of the ladies was from Lima and her daughter is in some English program, so she called her and she practiced some English with us. Octa made food and drinks for all of us, and we discovered an amazing condiment they have here called Tarí, which is a paste/cream of aji chiles. It's a little like mustard. We also learned from the ladies that there's still a 10pm curfew throughout Peru.
After the ladies left Octa's friends from the Santo Tomas trip came again to party for a few hours. After they left Octa talked to us for a while about his travels. He enjoys traveling with no money because it's more exciting and makes him feel wild. He told us about when he backpacked from Choqueqirao (archaeological site) to Macchu Piccu, a 13-day trip, with almost no food or water and came upon some people selling things, so he asked if there was a place to camp nearby and they took him in. He helped prepare the meal and ate with them.
One morning at breakfast Octa talked about how writing down his dreams makes him remember more of them. He told us that his dreams usually connect to something that has happened in real life. He recounted a specific dream where he was in court and had to choose between either being sentenced to death or paying a huge fine (possibly in installments). In real life, that day be had been riding to Cusco and came upon a truck driver who stopped him and was really impressed, so took him to the farm where he lived for a meal. At the farm the driver had Octa join him in slaughtering cows, and Octa thought of the cow as himself in the dream--the only reason it was being slaughtered was to be sold, so technically it could have just paid its way out of death. Octa said he would never pay his way out of death.
He also told us that he believes hair is like antennae for communicating with others, and that he was in Germany for a while and had a girlfriend there and then cut his hair and couldn't feel the same connection with her anymore. I asked him what about bald people and he said either they're Buddhist monks and learn to communicate via meditation and contemplation, or they just have some other sharp talents that make up for their inability to communicate telepathically.
Octa also always emphasizes that the kids who come to play in the treehouse are teachers, and he is the student, that so much can be learned from the kids. :)
Yesterday I explored the city some more and went to another plaza where there's a statue, some nice murals, and a sign that says Abancay: valley of eternal spring. Today we worked some on the terrace, where we've made a garden bed using some old windshields and truck tires, and planted a bunch of avocado pits and some vegetable seeds that I brought. A couple of the kids came to work with us a little. Octa can get a lot done fast. 
Guinea pig is a commonly eaten delicacy in Peru, and the other day Octa's mom prepared some to sell. We tasted the broth made from the guts. 
Last night we watched an old movie in Quechua (with Spanish subtitles) about a Peruvian vigilante who raided and robbed the Spanish colonists' hacienda estates. Called Laulico.
It looks like we might skip the next WWOOFing so that we have time to backpack and visit Macchu Piccu before flying out of Cusco on the 11th. We might leave Wed. Octa wants to take us over the snow caps of Ampay to Kiuñalla, then we'll continue on to visit Choqueqirao and trek to Machu Picchu.
The avocados continue to fall and nourish me. They often fall onto the metal roofs and make a huge noise.
I'm not sure if the picture quality is any good...
