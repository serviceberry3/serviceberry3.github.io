Choqueqirao was amazing. In case some of you are still wondering what it is, because it's come to my attention that some of you are, it's ruins of an Incan city, similar to Machu Picchu. Not many tourists go there or know about it, because in order to get there, you have to hike a full day down into a massive canyon and back up the other side. It's much bigger than Machu Picchu and a lot of it remains uncovered and unrestored. You can access the trails via a couple different villages. Rumor has it that a funicular will be built that connects one of the villages on this side (the highway) to the ruins, at which point I'm guessing it will flood with tourists. 

Octa's friend John, whom wed already met several times, works for a company that does tours of Choqueqirao and other places (although he doesn't speak English), so he let us come for free on one of the tours. "Tour" is a loose term here, he mostly just makes sure everyone arrives and organizes paying for food and lodgings. There are a couple of settlements, one near the bottom of the canyon (where the Apurimac River flows), another large one near the top of the side where Choqueqirao sits, and some other tiny ones sprinkled throughout. They offer camping, lodgings, and food to hikers. They also offer to "check" your bags via donkey and hike them for you. And they have horses that you can ride to Choqueqirao.

We accessed the trail via Cachora, and started at sunrise at a hut/camping area called Choqueqirao Wasi. In Quechua, wasi means house, and choqueqirao means golden crib. The hike in general had incredible views, especially towards the beginning, where a cluster of green mountains fade into snowy peaks (see pic). The rivers I've seen here are all very blue, too, which is nice. Joining us on the tour were two older women from a different city in Apurimac, and a group of ~30 year olds from yet another city in Apurimac. It was a group of friends and one of their cousins, and they all looked like they could be about 18 years old.

I brought a couple pounds of bread that I bought at a panaderia right near the treehouse, and I brought some Great Value fruit snacks I had leftover from my CT backpacking trip. Also leftover oat mix from Ampay.

We stopped for breakfast/lunch at the first settlement, where for some reason the mosquitos were hungry and numerous. Most notable was the juice of guanábana, or soursop, a fruit I had never heard of. They gave us a whole fruit afterwards and it was incredibly sweet. It has white flesh and pyramidal sections. 

After the meal we continued down to the river, where there's a sort of beach and a big suspension bridge. Then we did about a third of the climb up the other side of the canyon, to a camp called Santa Rosa. A little ways up I encountered one of the 30 year olds so I hiked with her the rest of the way to Santa Rosa and we discussed travel, COVID, hiking, her hometown, whether we'd rather be really cold or really hot, Octa's beliefs, what I was doing in Peru, and more. At Santa Rosa the whole group shared some beer. I met this young guy Brian who had moved from Lima to Cachora because some of his family lived there, and he worked driving the burro luggage up and down the mountains. He spoke Quechua too, and he looked like he really enjoyed his job. He had made it up to Santa Rosa fast so he went back down and handed people a Gatorade-type drink. 

After Santa Rosa we continued a steep climb to the settlement near the top of the mountain, passing a couple of small waterfalls. One of the 30 year olds named Eric, who was actually celebrating his birthday, gave me some coca leaves. When we reached the top I finally realized that my sleeping bag, which I thought I left at the bottom of the canyon because I didn't need it, had been added to the burro luggage. We had a meal of fried egg and rice at the "restaurant." We set up a tent and mattress outside, but ended up moving the whole tent inside where the other boys were sleeping because. Everyone came together for dinner, which was soup, followed by tea and then segundos of a rice pyramid with some meat, grilled onions, and potatoes. We hadn't slept the night before so went to bed, with Eric jokingly complaining to John about how there were no hot water bottles for his feet.

Wed morning we had breakfast of lentils and rice, along with a popular drink made from just hot water, flour, oats, and sugar. Octa's mom had also made it for us. Then we went to Choqueqirao, which was another 1.5-2 hrs of climbing. John taught us more slang and talked about TV shows along the way. He's a jokester, and often makes fun of Octa for being a hippie. He studied tourism for five years at the university in Abancay. On the hike, I was holding my camera and somehow dropped it down a steep decline (a decline that bridged two distant switchbacks). I had to slide/climb down a precarious rocky slope to retrieve it, which was hard. Luckily, it still worked! I just lost the lens cap. 

The Choqueqirao ruins were really cool, there's a main elevated plaza with a view of the entire fortress, a bunch of restored houses/dwelling spaces, and a lot of terraces. It really is a big site, it spans a huge slope. There's one giant sector of terraces alongside a steep staircase, and the terraces are decorated with llamas mosaiced in lighter-colored rocks. We ate packed lunches, and it turned out Eric and company had packed some rum and Coke to celebrate his birthday, which they shared with everyone.

John, Ian and I walked back from Choqueqirao together, talking about even more slang, the names of tropical fruits in Peru, and March Madness. When we got back to the camp, we met a guy from Norway who had been traveling Central/South America since September. Then we went to the room, where there was a little party for Erik going on. We joined in for a while, one of Erik's friends, Wilson, wanted to talk about video games and told us he makes big money playing poker online. Wilson also gave some of the others deep tissue massages because their legs were really sore. Brian also came to the party and evidently got drunk extremely easily. In general he was quiet but smiled widely all the time, and for that he seemed like a great guy. After the party we all went to eat dinner, where there was somehow a cake for Eric. A birthday cake on top of the mountain, where any groceries or supplies have to be hauled up via burro from Cachora. That amazed me. Dinner was some quinoa soup and then ulluco/papa lisa with rice. John kept telling the people in the kitchen to hurry up, which I thought was interesting. Meals here are definitely much quicker than in Spain. There was a guy from Mexico eating there that night and actually an American who we talked to. Later we sat in the restaurant with Brian and John and drank and interesting tea mixed with caña. 

The next morning we left early and returned to Capuliyoc, where we met John's cousin, who works at the Choqueqirao Wasi camping area. John bought us some Cusqueña negra beers, probably my favorite of the chelitas I've had here, and we enjoyed the incredible view from the picnic tables. Some people were weaving a straw roof to make another camping hut.

We drove back to Abancay, then the next day we helped Octa some in the garden making a second level of terrace and planting more avocado pits. That night Octa's friends came to watch the Colombia vs Peru game. They were tied, but Colombia unfortunately made a buzzer beater to end it. After those friends left Octa asked us where we thought we were 100 years ago. He also asked us what we think of death, and he said for some reason he feels like people who fear death the most are likely to die earlier, because death draws them in more. He said there had been times when he went to Ampay and had dreams that he would die, but now for some reason he feels invincible there and isn't scared of dying there at all. He said he's almost positive that we'll die before him, even though he's 10 years our senior. He said for some reason he feels like his friends who were there watching the game are stuck in a bubble, because they fear too much. Later some other friends of Octa's came by, and one of them turner out to be the owner of the farm near Abancay where we were going to WWOOF next.  Octa said he would love to visit the United States or live in some English-speaking country, but the place didn't matter at all. Only the people.

I tried to go to sleep but couldn't, then Octa woke me up at 230 to say bye :'( We left for cusco around 6 am. In Cusco we ate lunch at a classic polleria, then walked to the city center where we stayed in a French-owned hotel for $5 each. I bought one bottle of chicha morada and one of chicha de jora, but they were way too sweet compared to what we had in Abancay. I finally showered for the first time since June 15. We ate dinner at a local restaurant for about $1.30, a two course meal. Soup and then bistec montado, with mate. The Argentina vs Brazil game was finishing up on the TV. For some reason they didn't have drinks at the restaurant except mate, which I thought was interesting. Afterwards I bought a bunch of Peruvian.candies, including wavers with an eggfruit-flavored filling. 

We're now about to board a flight to Lima. I get to Chazuta tonight, in the rainforest.<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG_20210708_150858.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
