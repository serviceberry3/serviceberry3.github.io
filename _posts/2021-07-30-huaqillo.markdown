Víctor and Elsi have both lived here all their life, and haven't travelled, pretty much not even in Perú. So that's already really different from my other two hosts. The house is adobe, it's actually quite big. Víctor built it from 1997-2008 while he was in high school and did everything himself. Impressive. It seems like people here have a different accent from that of the Abancayans, and also a different manner of speaking. They're harder to understand, I'd say. Also, Octa had travelled and knew Italian, and could also form some sentences in English, and José knew English and several other languages well (although only spoke to me in Spanish), but Victor and Elsi only know Spanish. Interestingly, no one here in the Tamborapa/Tabaconas area speaks Quechua, but a little further north, like in San Ignacio, there are some Quechua speakers. 

There's no service here, but recently (around Feb) the family had electricity and internet installed. The internet connection apparently comes from a solar-powered receiver on a nearby hill that connects with the tower network. Since it's solar sometimes it runs out. But the internet is fairly fast considering how remote this area is. Today I helped them attach a second router to their first router for better coverage. They want to sell some WiFi use to their neighbors who live behind a hill and can't reach the connection. There's a young guy who lives nearby who comes and hides in the trees to steal their WiFi. So yes, even here they have to password protect it.

They have two small white dogs named Doggy and Revolver, two geese, some cows, a bull, chickens, and I think a horse. They get fresh milk from one of the cows every day, which I just tried heated up with some chancaca tonight. They actually make the chancaca by milling the raw sugar cane plant. They make fresh cheese a lot using the rennet of a cow (they just put the whole cow stomach in the milk and the cheese is usually done in around 30 min). 

There's a lot to recount...Víctor told me in the past he's had up to 18 WWOOFers at once, and when I asked where they all slept he said that was the problem, he wasn't expecting that many, but Giancarlos had just posted about the farm on Couchsurfing or something and a swarm of people came to Huaqillo without warning :) Some WWOOFers had actually stayed for like a month, then left to travel somewhere else, then had come back. One had left and come back múltiple times. Lots of Europeans, some from Brasil, and one American had come who was openly racist and wouldn't drink coffee because it was black. Since the pandemic hit I think no WWOOFers had come.

There's about a hectare of coffee plants, most of which just last about 6 years, but some of which can last up to 100. Most of the coffee is on a mountainside. There are a ton of banana plants, and some cacao, naranjilla, and pineapple. The coffee harvest season lasts from about March-September. The coffee plant is not at all what I thought it was. It's a juicy red berry, with the bean at the center surrounded by two shells/skins. There are some other varieties that are yellow. After removing the outer shell, the fruits look exactly like peanuts. The green berries ripen in waves, so the harvest is also done in waves. We've almost finished this wave, just have a couple rows left until all the reds are picked. That's all I do in terms of work, is pick the coffee. It's very easy and doesn't really take any energy, which is nice. It's also satisfying. We all usually work together: Vladi, Victor, Felipe, and I. Sometimes the rest of the family comes too. Walking up the coffee path to the plants is the hardest part of the day, although sometimes going back down is harder if it's wet. The weather here is rainy and in the 70s, really nice. We bring in a lot of coffee every day, it's fast picking. I'm not sure in kg but we usually fill at least two huge burlap sacks daily. It's not as much as it seems, since the outer shells take up a lot of area. We do one picking session in the morning and one after lunch, and after each, Vladi hauls the sack on his shoulders running down the mountain back to the house. 

The meals here are huge, which is weird to me. Although I realized after a day that usually it's mostly rice or other carbs. We eat wayy too many carbs. I'll talk more about the food in another post. And the coffee process.

Victor, Elsi, and the family live what seems like a great and happy life, besides the crazy amount of carbs and slight lack of vegetables. Everyone is always really happy. They make plenty of money with the coffee to sustain themselves, because the farm provides them with a lot of food. Victor said here money is much less of a worry than in the city. A lot of people in the city, he said, make about 1000 soles per month, and are starving. But he can make like 1000 soles per year and be fine.

Some interesting things: the whole time I've been in Perú, I've been trying to figure out how the seasons work. In Abancay the consensus was clearly that it was winter, and that made sense because that's apparently when it got the coldest at night. But at José's, I asked him what the weather was like in summer if it was this hot in winter, and he said it was currently summer, which is when I started to get confuZled. He said basically summer is just whenever it's not raining as much, and that was now and in Jan/Feb, I think. But what was even more confusing is that the schools there seemed to have a long summer-like break from October-December. And here I asked Víctor what season we're in, and he didn't really know, he said maybe autumn. I told him I'd just conclude that seasons didn't exist here, and he said that was pretty much right. Here in Huaqillo it's almost always the same temperature, and sometimes it rains for a long time, or sometimes it's sunny for a long time.
Another interesting fact about Perú is that there seems to be no widely-used, government-run shipping system. Even in Lima. I had noticed that all of the double decker bus companies accept encomiendas: for a certain fee you can send a package along to someone in the bottom of the bus. Even the random little transportation companies that go to the villages do this. Victor said that was the only way that parcels were sent in Perú, as far as he knew.
