The bus to Jaén stopped in quite a few towns along the way, like Moyobamba, where a lot of people got on. Since I hadn't actually purchased a ticket, someone booted me out of my seat. Luckily there was space on the first floor, where there are the deluxe chairs that fold down to almost 180 degrees. After yet another seemingly crazy, dark double decker bus ride on curvy mountain roads, I got to Jaén and as usual there were a bunch of mototaxistas heckling the passengers as they got off the bus. Supposedly Tarapoto is an extremely safe city, but various Peruvians told me there are a lot of bad people in Jaén. There were signs in the bus station warning not to trust anyone. Even though the mototaxistas told me it was SUUPER far to the stop where cars left for Tamborapa Pueblo, I walked, and it wasn't even that far. The only problem was I had no idea where the stop was, and those stops are never marked well on Google Maps, so I had to ask a guy working at the bus station. I got to the stop and found the company who drove to Tamborapa Pueblo, but there seemed to be no activity there. Someone told me cars might show up later. I waited for a while and then another guy asked me where I was going, then told me there was another stop right down the street where a car would leave for TP soon. It turns out there were 3 or 4 stops right next to each other. I finally found one where the guy said he was going to Tamborapa Pueblo, and I sat and waited for a while. Usually these kinds of cars wait for a while to try to gather as many passengers as possible so they can make as much money as possible. Then they leave whenever they've filled a quota. Sometimes, like in Chazuta, they even drive around yelling at people to ask if they needed to go to X place. I sat and waited for hours, the guy kept saying we would leave in media horita or so, and it kept seeming like we had enough passengers, but then some would leave because they didn't want to wait, and it was a vicious cycle. I kept asking when we we would leave. Finally we left at like 1 pm, it was probably the bumpiest ride of my life. The trip was around 4 hours, at least 3 of which were on a terrible dirt road through the mountains. Idk if I mentioned it in past blogs, but the curvy mountain roads are often narrow. In Abancay they weren't as narrow, but everyone ignored the lane lines. People don't usually slow down on blind curves, they just blast the horn, cross their hearts, and hope to die. A lot of cars or taxis here say "God guides us" or something similar. Also everyone passes all the time, because there are usually a lot of slow trucks and motorcycles on the road. So the ride to Tamborapa was similar but on a road made of pure bumps. It was pretty slow. We stopped in a bunch of villages, finally got to Tamborapa Pueblo, where Vladi came to pick me up on his motorcycle and take me to Huaqillo, the coffee farm where I am now. Good thing I chose to bring just a backpack to Peru. Tragically, I realized on the way to Huaqillo I had left my water filter in the car. The ride to Huaqillo was beautiful. The air was nice and crisp. This is also my favorite part of Peru so far, landscape wise. It's very green and hilly, with lots of farms and nice little villages. Below is a picture of Vladi and me shortly after I arrived, after not eating for two days because of always waiting for a vehicle that might leave at any time. Huaqillo is a caserío (small village), and the farm is a few minutes' ride from the village. (The village is a just a couple buildings.) The farm is owned by a family: Victor and Elsi (about 40 yrs old), Vladi (19), Felipe (12), Gata (I think 8, although I forget), and Ariana. Víctor's niece is named Giancarlos, and he's the one who organizes the WWOOFers. He lives in Piura but comes to the farm sometimes. When I arrived Victor and Elsi greeted me warmly, and as I expected, served me coffee. It was really good, although I knew it wasn't exactly what I needed after pretty much not sleeping the night before. They take their roasted coffee and make a very concentrated brew which they then just add to hot water whenever they want it. That night we ate a dinner of I think rice, a tuna and onion salad, and something else I think. It tasted pretty amazing, whatever it was.<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG-20210725-WA0007.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
