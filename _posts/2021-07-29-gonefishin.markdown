07/22

Today late afternoon around 4 Nelli and Pollix came back from Chazuta and whipped up some pineapple juice which was extremely foamy and refreshing. I noted that Nelli and Jose grow all of the ingredients needed to make a pina colada: sugar cane, coconut, and pineapple. Jose's dad had said he wanted to plant more sugar cane and try making rum. Then we peeled the roasted cacao beans for a while, and ate dinner of spaghetti with tomato sauce and fish, and the red paint berries. We talked about animated TV shows, including Curious George, and Alonzo gave us some riddles. Nelli had heard Pepa the Pig made kids more rebellious. Maybe thats also why my parents didn't let me watch Spongebob as a kid. Nelli also said she likes hosting wwoofers because it's like travelling without having to go anywhere. They bring their cultures to her. There's a tradition here in San Martin where parents never cut their babies' hair until their 3rd birthday, and they make a big party out of the cutting. They also don't wash the baby's hair so it becomes dreadlocky. Its funny to me how Nelli and Jose say they're cold when its like 70 degrees. Also the USD went down a little bit, which means the prices of things in Perú, even here in the village, also go down, like cacao. Nelli and Jose sell the cacao in bulk to a store in Chazuta. There are cute cucarachas here which have large shells. I've also seen some frogs and big spiders. I was hoping to see a monkey because Jose and David both told me they've seen one from a distance before. I forgot to mention that in Peru, its customary to say "thanks everyone" after the meal. But if I say thanks to Nelli for the meal, that's weird.

Last day on the cacao farm. Jose stayed in Chazuta and Nelli had come back the night before. Today Nelli found 2 people in Tupac to do work. One of them worked in the morning in exchange for breakfast and lunch. For breakfast some niños from Tupac, friends of Pollix, came (children of the workers). It was very interesting that Nelli found two workers today--Jose and Nelli had told me that it seemed like some men from Tupac only wanted to come to work at Jangalayacu to see Nelli, so they would usually come only when Jose was gone. Sure enough, the day Jose was gone was the day the workers came...

I peeled a bunch of cacao, then we had lunch and the worker (muchacho) told me he was looking for a white wife and that I should bring my girlfriend to visit Tupac, that he would pay for her ticket. He asked me if in the US we had similar fresh water fish to those in Tupac, and I learned fresh water is "sweet water" in Spanish. After lunch I finished peeling the cacao, then Jose came back and Jose, Nelli, and I ground the cacao using a mill into a powder. Jose said his dad, many years ago, had invested in coffee by buying a bunch from Ecuador or Peru and selling it to the US. But then the price crashed and he lost a lot. Jose wanted to make his chocolate brand to support his reforestation project, and he said that would also make an attractive label.

That night a friend, Don Jesus, came for dinner. He explained the difference between a mule and a donkey, which I sadly didn't even know existed. A mule is the product of a donkey breeding with a horse. I also learned that Jose is known in Tupac as Don Pepe, apparently Pepe is a Nickname for Jose. At dinner we talked some about the COVID vaccines. The vaccination process is different in each región of Perú. Nelli (31) had already received both doses, she'd gotten the second one while I was there. Jose was still too old but wasn't going to take the vaccine because he didn't trust it yet. I've already heard tons of theories about COVID in Peru. A lot seem to think China created COVID for various reasons, even just so they could feed their production of PPE. It didn't seem like Jose knew much about the vaccines or the trials in general. He does only access the Internet once a week.

After dinner Nelli and the kids went to the culmination of the hair cutting birthday party, where they were actually cutting the hair, and Jose and I went to a bar where we got some homemade caña. Jose wanted to know if I thought the construction of the US interstate system was a good thing, or if it disturbed the natural landscapes and forests of the US too much. He said when he had first moved to Tupac, there was a lot of old growth rainforest and more vegetation, and now they were building a highway that went past Chazuta down the Huallaga, and also just more housing development, power lines, etc. which was disappointing. I had also expected it to be less developed than it is. But there still isn't Internet. I also asked him what he did for fun when he was working in California and Miami, he said his jobs were usually fun because he got to work in kitchens making food, etc. and he liked the people. He said he wasnt that much of a party person, but he did go to Vegas a couple times, which was fun until a girl he was talking to in a casino bar who seemed nice told him he would have to pay for her services. Apparently in Miami he worked right next door to a night club and everyone would come in drunk at night, which was funny. He also had dated some in LA but had apparently ended up just being friends with most of the people he dated. :'( He had unfortunately dated a girl who had a twin whom he liked a lot more, but only the other twin liked him. He said he had liked Nelli because she seems somewhere in between a city slicker and a farmer, even though she's lived on farms her whole life.

07/24

I woke up, Nelli made some oats with cacao, and I ate some of the best olives of my life. I gave Jose and Nelli a 2 dollar bill that was in my wallet, which Jose recognized as being good luck. He also noticed that on the back of the bill, theres a depiction of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but there's a weird-looking dragonfly or satellite flying around. I wonder whats up with that. After that I just sat and talked with Jose for a long time because I had apparently missed the early boats to Chazuta. The boats are really just random people who are going to Chazuta and will let people hitch rides. Jose told me about how when he worked in LA at Greco's Pizzeria, first of all, they had giant pizzas that cost more than 50 dollars and didn't even fit normally through a car door. Also they would let the workers take a slice, which was partially pre-cooked, and top it, then cook it for themselves. Also they'd once received a giant delivery order from a mansion in the Hollywood hills, and it got crazy in the kitchen. His manager got really made at him because he spilled a whole pasta dish on the floor. Usually in the mornings before work he'd get cheap but good Mexican food for breakfast. He also really liked Carl's Jr and the cheapness of fast food in general, since he had been broke. He told me about how he had liked Miami a lot because there are a lot of foreigners there, nice beaches and small bodies of water in the city, and lots of sun. But he mostly liked it at night, and recently it had become too expensive. He also recalled that when he was living in North Hollywood, there had been a guy who robbed the Bank of America armed with heavy automatic rifles, and he had been chased by the police in his car but escaped. Then later he tried to rob another bank and was shot down. The shootout was pretty famous and someone had made a movie about it. Then we talked about OJ Simpson for a while, and I told him all about Elon Musk's companies because he didn't know who Elon Musk was. Jose's sister lives in Toronto because she'd met a guy there and married him. Jose lived there for a while and loved how much vast wilderness and land in general Canada has despite its small population. We also talked about how his parents' divorce had caused him to worry more about money and his future. He said Nelli was the opposite of him and was just now starting to worry about those things. And we debated why people were considered adults at age 18, and what's a good age to start leaving your child home alone. Finally a boat passed which was headed to Chazuta, so I hopped in. It was a large family and they stopped for a while to net some fish, at which point I waded with them to shore and soaked my pants and socks. Finally I got to Chazuta, found a car to Tarapoto immediately, and made it to the Tarapoto bus station right at 16:00, where there appeared to be one last bus headed to Jaén scheduled to leave at that hour. Unfortunately they said they were out of seats, but I waited at the station to see if maybe I could get on. Sure enough, the bus was in the shop and was still being fixed, and it wasn't showing up. 2 hours passed, I figured it would probably arrive then, because our bus from Abancay to Cusco had been 2 hours late. Another 2 hours passed and people were getting mad, because the girl at the desk wasn't really sure if the "carro" would come or not. I was about to text Edvin, Nelli's cousin, but then I saw some passengers change their tickets to the next day. I asked the girl if now I could buy a pasaje and she said the system wouldn't let her sell anymore, but I could just pay at the door. Finally at 9 the bus showed up, loaded up, then we sat there and waited for a while as the bus crew loitered around eating snacks and joking with the people working at the desk. They kept rolling their shirts up to their nipples for some reason.
