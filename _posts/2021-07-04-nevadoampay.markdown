Early in the week, we worked on the terrace some more. Some of Octa's friends came to help, they were skaters and one of them was into fingerboarding. That one also had a lot of suggestions for the terrace and thought the avocados would take a very long time to germinate. On Tuesday we went to the city center to try ceviche for the first time. It was delicious. Served with toasted corn and a spicy sauce. Afterwards we got some ice cream cones topped with peanuts and went to check out a plaza. We worked some more in the garden, and Octa's friend Jorge came by and gave us juice and cookies. He told us that when we go to Ampay (a nearby mountain peak) we should suck on coca leaves and take a lick of soil so that we might become more accustomed to the mountain. A lot of people here believe the sky and earth are beings of their own, and some people pour out some of their drink as an offering to the earth. Tue afternoon Ian and I went for a run around a soccer field further uphill.
On Wed we hitchhiked with Octa and his friend to 57R952XQ+HR, where there's an old suspension bridge covered with husks, over a big river. There are some gushing rapids nearby which slow to a weak current under the bridge. First we took a taxi to the center of Abancay, where Octa picked up some used inner tubes at an auto repair shop. Then we hopped in a van going towards some village, but it turned out to be taking a different route, so we eventually had to get out and wait for another van on the highway. When we got to the bridge we explored a little, and Octa and Ian went for a lazy river ride in the inner tubes. We cooked over a fire, and a man who lived nearby came to tell us to fully put out the fire because a single spark could destroy the husk bridge. The river was very blue and very clear. We played music and sunbathed, and Octa asked us what we like about the US.
At some point early in the week I caught a cold and felt bad for several days. On Thursday I mostly rested, and ate many bananas that we'd sun-dried in a box on top of the treehouse. 
Yesterday at the crack of dawn we (Ian, Octa, and I) took a taxi up to somewhere near the Tuneles de Karcatera and hiked up to Laguna Willcaqocha, which sits at 4600 meters above sea level. The hike only took the day, and the path was very well-cut. It zigzagged through a lot of cow pastures and small farms. Beautiful views the whole way. A lot of cows were hanging out on the trail and sometimes didn't want to move! Tons of cow poop too. We all mostly went at our own paces. Octa would stop occasionally to meditate or nap, and once when we thought he was way behind, he suddenly appeared far above us on a cliff, as if he'd teleported there. It became fairly difficult to breathe after around 4000m. When we arrived at the lagoon, which sits at the base of the "snow cap" (there's not that much snow), Octa wanted to continue upwards, but I was too exhausted. So we camped right next to the lagoon, in a tent. We cooked some chicken and ramen with a liquid fuel stove that Octa brought. My stomach was a little upset so Octa gave me some coca leaves to suck on. As the sun set it got super cold, and Octa told us some stories about his past trips to Ampay. Supposedly when he was four he had tried to reach the peak of Ampay by himself (there's a trail that starts on the edge of Abancay), and made it pretty far. He said when he was little he liked to try eating whatever plants and mushrooms he could find to learn what each did. Sounds like a great idea. He also told us some stories about when he mountain biked the summit, which sounded crazy. Another time he had been on the summit when it was pouring rain. 
He told us so many stories/things that I don't remember all of them. He said he felt like he owned Ampay and all of the mountains there, that he'd explored every corner of the park, and that one day he wanted to find or create a nice cave in Ampay and live there and maybe create a community up there. He told us about some faces he saw in the rock face surrounding the lagoon, and asked us what expressions we saw. He said he liked to rock climb in Ampay, without a harness or anything. He told us about a time he came alone to the snow cap and slept in a cave, and he peed into a bottle and drank it. Apparently it tasted like water because he had been so hydrated. That didn't exactly make sense. Apparently people often came with him to the nevado but then abandoned him in the end, which is basically what we did. He asked us what we thought equivocarse meant. He apparently once encounter a puma in Ampay and wanted to see another one so that he could connect with it. I told him it seemed like he enjoyed feeling pain, but he said "I enjoy feeling."
We made some fire with straw we found and then got in the tent at sundown and spent about 15 hours there. It was freezing. The water in my bottle turned to ice, and ice crystals formed on my backpack. I don't think I slept at all until the sun rose and warmed up the tent.
We cooked some breakfast and ate some of the other food we brought: bread, margarine, candies (hard candies and Nestle Sublime), bars (chocman), and a trail mix we made in the treehouse by cooking oats with chancaca, raisins, and peanuts. After that Octa continued with the original plan: summiting the nevado off-trail and going down the other side to the highway, then hitchhiking to Kiuñalla. We were struggling with the elevation and didn't want to go all the way to the snow cap, so we went down through the sanctuary, past the big blue lagoon (Uspaccocha, which I thought was the most beautiful part of Ampay), and down the forested trail that connects to the north side of Abancay. When we first left camp and were reaching the highest point we met some young people from Abancay who said they'd been hiking since 3 am, and one of the guys knew Octa from middle school. They gave us some fruits, tamales, and toasted corn. 
Once we got to the gate of Ampay and passed the huachimán, we had to walk another hour down the road to get back to La Casa del Árbol. Tomorrow we'll go to Kiuñalla by taxi, although I unfortunately forgot to ask Octa where the cars to Kiuñalla can be found, and his mom doesn't seem to know. Octa seemed to think he'd arrive at Kiuñalla tonight, but we haven't heard from him. Hopefully he's okay.

This is a picture of where we camped.
