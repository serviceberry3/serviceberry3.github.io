Wow, it's been a crazy couple of days. I still don't understand how we were in Lima just yesterday, but we were. We took a taxi to San Isidro where we walked around for a while (of course all of the taxistas at the airport are really annoying and try to scam tourists with crazy prices), went to an open-air art market, then met my cousin twice removed, Jens, at a pizzeria. He invited a friend, Sebastian, who had partially grown up in Florida. We ate bruschetta and pizzas, I got a cusque√±a negra beer. Talked a lot about what we were doing in Peru and why. Peruvians are the worst, they said. In order to get anything done that needed government support, you needed to either have an in with someone, or bribe someone. After the meal Ian and I went to a big mall which was full of American fast food chains (even Taco Bell), then returned to the airport. When I got to Tarapoto is when all the shenanigans began. Jose, the guy I'm staying with now, had seemed to think there would still be vans departing to Chazuta when I arrived, which was around 8 pm. But the mototaxistas at the airport said there were no more cars to Chazuta, but that there were a lot during the day and the first left at 4 am. One of them took me to a hostal near the city center. The taxis are 1/2 motorcycles with little carriages attached to the back. It started raining right as we left so the driver pulled out a makeshift windshield screen, which was just some piece of fabric or something. He had to crane his neck to see the road over the screen. I got to the hostal and talked to the guy working, but it didn't seem worth it to stay just 7 hours. He reduced the price a lot but I decided to just wait in the street until 4. I sat near the hostal, and soon met another mototaxista named Fabian, because I turned out to be sitting in front of his garage. He was super nice and asked me a lot about myself, and also told me about some nice waterfalls and viewpoints around Tarapoto. Apparently the chassis of his taxi had broken. Once he put it in the garage he started playing classic 80s hits. His sister had a little shop right next to the hostal and she filled up my water for me. I still had a Nestle Sublime fiesta and a Princesa bar which I ate. Soon the guy working at the hostal came out and offered me an even lower price for a room, but, "normal," I told him, I would be patient. Only five or so hours left. 
Later the concierge guy came out again and offered me a cigarette and talked to me for a while, mostly about how he goes every six months to these herbal cleansing session. Ayahuasca and herbal medicine/drugs are huge in Peru, especially in the rainforest area. The sessions he did were with San Pedro, a cactus-looking plant that contains a potent liquid. He said there was sort of an altar where the participants could leave offerings - wine, food, objects. Then they all drank the San Pedro and the maestro would try to read each person based on the effects the San Pedro had on them, because it was always different for each person. The maestro was like a shaman and would sort of diagnose each person or make a prediction about something wrong with their health or their lifestyle. He was almost always right apparently. The concierge guy turned out to be named Manuel and was only 23, studying to be an environmental lawyer. That was the future, he told me, that only governments and companies could change. They needed to stop lying about their statistics and ignoring what was going on. This reminds me of a couple things so far. First of all, pachamama (mother earth) is highly respected in Peru, and it's a tradition to pour out some of one's drink on the ground before drinking, as an offering. Octa's brother Guillermo was the first one to tell us about that, but the only person in Abancay who seemed to take it seriously was John. Anyway, some of the San Pedro was poured out during the session. Another interesting thing: there's apparently a world renowned Ayahuasca recovery clinic in Tarapoto, where addicts from all over the world go to purify and clean themselves. Octas friend Jorge first told me about it when I said I was going to Tarapoto, and then Jens and his friend also talked about it. Supposedly Lindsay Lohan went there to get clean and it worked like a charm. Anyway, I asked Manuel if he really believed the sessions purified him, and he did. He said the clinic in Tarapoto wasn't a good idea though, because it would be stupid to take herbal medicines in such a distracting urban environment surrounded by modern technology and equipment.

At 3 am I went to the Plaza de Armas of Tarapoto, the city felt like a ghost town besides the occasional mototaxi breaking the silence and whizzing past. Then I went to the stop where the Chazuta cars depart. I got there early and the gates were shut so it was hard to find at first. The driver fastened my big backpack to the top of the car, then we left around 430. He stopped in some villages to deliver gas. The highway was sort of half finished, with some unpaved and holey areas, so it was really bumpy. When I got to Chazuta at around 5:30 it was still dark and I didn't know what to do, because Jose had said he would wait for me on Sun night in Chazuta, but it was now Mon morning and my messages to him didnt seem to be delivering. I sat in the plaza for a few hours waiting to see if he texted anything. Some people came up to talk to me, the gringo in town. One guy came out of a shop and asked me if I liked to drink what sounded like "kahway." I asked what it was, he said a type of very strong tea, I asked if it was a drug he said yes. I asked how one felt when they drank it, he said jittery. I finally asked how it was spelled and he said c-a-f-e. Whoops. I asked him if he knew where this farm was, but no. Finally at around 8 am this girl was sitting next to me on the bench and asked what I was doing in Chazuta. I explained and she said she thought she might live near the farm, and had met a French and Korean recently who seemed to be going to a similar place. She instructed me to go ask at this hostal because they knew the farmer well. The hostal then directed me to ask the owner of a shop, who redirected me to a man sitting across the street doing nothing who supposedly worked for Jose. The shopowner said something about how David had been waiting for me last night. That man and his wife seemed to know Jose, who APPARENTLY also went by David. I told the man I was from the United Stated but he kept thinking I was from Argentina or Chile. He seemed a little delirious. I confirmed that David's real name was Jose, and showed the man a Facebook pic of Jose, which he seemed to recognize. Or I thought I confirmed. The wife called over another man who supposedly worked for David, and he called David and put me on the phone with him. The guy on the phone sounded French and spoke English well, which confused me even more because I knew Jos spoke French and English in addition to Spanish, although I thought he was Peruvian. Anyway the French dude didn't know who I was, which made me think it definitely wasn't Jos, because I had been whatsapping him and he seemed excited to host me. But anything is possible in the selva, I thought, maybe he was just always high on something. Anyway David told me I should just come to where he lived to talk in person. The couple had a boy named Segundo, who knew David, lead me to said place, which was up a dirt road. On the way he told me about all these crazy fruits that only grow in this region, and he said he moved here from Tarapoto and liked the quietness, but that people from the countryside always wanted to go to the city eventually and vice versa. I got to David's place, still 1/4 expecting to meet Jose, but David clearly wasnt Jose. He was some druggie from Paris who moved here to start a new life and open up a sort of medicinal healing clinic. He gave me some water with lemon and sugar, and a fruit that I'd never seen before. It had a yellow shell with red innards. I think it was called guayaba. He also gave me a piece of bread. I asked why he came to Peru and he said Paris had gotten too crazy, especially with the pandemic. David then gave me a tour of the place. Apparently he has guests come to stay and take psychedelics or medicinal plants, or just relax. He hires local workers from Chazuta to build stuff for him, and he has a painter from Chile staying there and painting some murals on the main hut. He showed me the ayahuasca plant and some other plants, including a tree with white sap, that supposedly cured arthritis or other aches and pains. I showed the workers there Jos's Facebook profile, and luckily one of them recognised him and told me he lived further down the river, in a place called Tupac. Segundo led me back to Chazuta and took me in his mototaxi to a friend to see if he knew more about where Jos lived, but he didn't reconize Jos. Then we went to the hostal and finally the owner knew Jos and told me to go to Tupac and ask around because everyone there knows each other. Segundo said I would have to go down the river in a boat, so he took me to the landing and there was a boat about to leave. I got in, the boat was very long and slender like a canoe, with a motor in the back. There was a bunch of cargo and some other passengers. The ride was long, we stopped at some other villages first to drop off people and cargo. I lost cell service along the way, the villages far from Chazuta don't have internet apparently. The Huallaga river is really big and wide. It flows into another river which flows into the Amazon. The views were really nice, you can see the rainforest enshrouded in clouds, rising into mountains in the background. It looks just like Lost. Finally I got to the port of Tupac Amur (a small village on the Huallaga), I went to the center and everyone there knew where Jose and Nelli lived. Although all they said was that it was a driveway near the bridge, and at first I went into one and there were some huts and I waited for the owners to come back but it wasnt Jos, he said to go further down. Finally I found Jangalayacu, the name of Jos' conservation project. I went in and FINALLY found Jose and Nelli. I think it was around 11 am by this point, but I forget.



Jose and Nelli both seemed really nice. Jose is from Lima, Nelli is from Chazuta. Jose is 41 and Nelli is 31. They have two kids, Pollix and Alonzo, Alonzo is Nellis kid from a different father. For some reason Jose was wearing an LSU t shirt. Apparently his mom gave it to him. Jose has lived here for about 6 years. We ate some beans, rice, and boiled banana which kind of seemed like a banana-plantain mix. Jose said he, Nelli, and Pollix were leaving soon to go to Tarapoto and would spend the night there.
Jos is very sharp and worldly, and curious. He has spent time in the US and his uncle lives in Canada. He also lived in Belgium for a year and in French Canada for some time. He speaks German, French, English, and Spanish, but not Quechua. I sat with him for a while and explained the crazy puzzle of how I had found him. I told him I should make a movie called Finding Jose. He had gone to Chazuta the day before and waited for me for some time, but then he went home, and he doesn't have service here. So I guess he just assumed I would eventually find him. I stayed at the farm while they went to Tarapoto, supposedly to buy a washing machine, and I was pretty much falling asleep already at 2. I took a nap then picked up some leaves on the lawn. Later Alonzo told me there was some avena drinkable oats in the kitchen. 



07/13
I woke up and Joses dad was there. He showed me a  breakfast of hot cocoa (with house made chocolate), olives, and banana.
Then we went to Tupac the village and he showed me around a little. We sat by the river for a while, for some reason he had like 3 cell phones, I think with different carriers because he was trying to get a signal. Supposedly Tupac was supposed to be covered, but he couldn't seem to get a signal. I couldn't either. He showed me how the fishermen cast nets and then towed them with the boats. We walked around the village and said hi to some friends, then went back to the house. There I picked up leaves until around 1, when we went back to the village. We went to a friends house, his name is Ramiro and he's a fisherman. His son cooks the fish to serve to customers and wants to move to Barcelona to work in a restaurant. Jose's dad's (also named Jose) brother lived in Barcelona. Anyway Ramiro welcomed us with Coke and ca√±a, but this ca√±a was golden colored because apparently it had been mixed with some medicinal root. Supposedly it made you very strong, and it was impossible to get a hangover from it. Ramiro's son brought out the food, which was a heaping plate of fried catfish with fried bananas and an amazing red onion salad. There was an aji sauce to go with it, as usual. Ramiro kept repeating himself a lot, and thought I didn't understand what I was saying. He kept saying "welcome to my humble home," and Jose's dad, Don Jose, would keep trying to translate everything Ramiro said into English. Jose's dad speaks some English, he apparently worked for Proctor and Gamble in Lima with some English speakers, and he traveled to New York sometimes. He currently lives in Lima but came to live at the farm for three years at one point. He doesn't like Lima much because there are too many people and its kind of ugly. There are also like 3 million people there who basically live in tent camps outside the city, with no electricity or plumbing. Apparently one of his brothers (he originally had 8 siblings, a couple have died) is going to come live on the farm and build a separate house. Anyway, Ramiro said he wanted to teach me how to fish the next day, or at least being me along so I could see how it was done. After the meal Ramiro wanted to take me out for a ride in the boat for fun with his friend/assistant, but Don Jose told me that wasn't a good idea because Ramiro and his friend were drunk. So Jose told Ramiro I had to go back to the house to wait for little Jose. We went back, I picked up some more leaves and then Jose, Nelli, and Pollix got back. They hadn't bought a washing machine :( That night for dinner we had some boiled catfish. At basically every meal we have some cocoa, sometimes with milk and sugar, as well as a refresco, which is some blend of water and fruits, like cocona, lemon, etc. We also usually have boiled or roasted bananas, which are also grown on the farm. Jose found out via my Facebook profile that I go to Yale, and wanted to know all about it, what I was studying, etc. He was like "isn't that one of the best universities in the world, like equal to Harvard?" Yeah, but there was one thing wrong with that statement. Anyway, he's evidently knows a lot about the US and is very curious about how things work there.

There are a few buildings on the farm: a small brick house with a kitchen and bedroom, a straw/wooden hut with a bedroom and an attic space, a little shower stall, a pavilion, and a bathroom structure. Jose and Nelli built everything with some help from friends and family. Its really nice, with real plumbing (water comes from a nearby branch of the Huallaga called the Quebrada), and there's electricity in the main brick house. I sleep in the attic of the second hut. The farm is both a farm and a reforestation project. Jose is constantly planting new trees of various kinds where there's empty space. There's about a hectare of cacao plants, some pineapples, coconuts, lemon trees, and cotton. The main income is selling cacao fruit and beans. I've gotten to taste some ripe cacao fruit, it has yellow skin and the beans are inside surrounded by very sweet white flesh which can be sucked. I've also tried some aged/dried beans which are drying in the sun, and some actual chocolate bar that they made. 

Apparently it rains here about half of the time, although its currently the dryer season. And when its not raining,  it's hot, humid, and sunny. It usually stays in the 80s day and night, getting up to around 90 at peak heat.

That night after dinner Jose asked if I wanted to join on a walk to Tupac Amur, so he, Nelli, and I went. Nelli had to go to some parents meeting for the school. Jose and I sat by the river for a while talking about whether aliens existed and how American companies were dumping petroleum waste into parts of the Amazon. Apparently someone had once told Jose that two species of Aliens had landed on earth and created humans, I told him that was exactly an  We walked around the village a little, and also talked about religion, whether gods exist, whether the soul is a real thing, and whether there's life after death. Jose isn't very religious and thinks the Bible is mostly false because some has been refuted by recent archaeological discoveries. But he does believe the soul exists and possibly persists after death somehow. He encouraged me to believe that the soul is real and said its natural for us to reject it because its difficult for our bodies to comprehend. We also talked about time travel and I told him that we wouldn't know time travel was discovered until many years later because governments would conceal it due to the danger. I told Jose that supposedly time seemed to pass faster and faster as you age, such that at age 18 its like about half of your life has passed. He wasnt convinced but said all he knew was that time was flying now and that he had to make the most of every day. We also talked some about traveling. Hed lived in Belgium for a year and wanted to visit Denmark and Scandinavia, which I told him was like a utopia. He asked me how old I was in 2000 and I said 0. He told me that when the Internet was first becoming a thing, a lot of people starting messaging pen pals, and some European girl messaged him all the time and would send him unsolicited nude pictures. While we were sitting in Tupac this drunk guy kept coming up to us and ranting, it was Ramiro's fishing assistant. Finally Nellis meeting ended and we walked back to the farm. Nelli also apparently believes strongly that the soul exists.


07/14
Woke up like 7, Nelli made a nice breakfast of crepes, they were amazing crepes. We topped them with the maple syrup that I brought. I explained how maple syrup was made and that it was a luxury because it took a lot of sap to make just a little syrup.

After that I worked for a couple hours. Ive mostly been working in the cacao orchard combing the plants for this invasive sort of parasite plant. Its called pishcoisman, which in Quechua means bird poop. Supposedly its carried from tree to tree by birds and then it stems off of the cacao branches and steals resources from the cacao plants. So I removed them. There are a lot of them and supposedly Jose has around 1000 cacao plants. I've also helped Jose a little to cut down the weeds using a machete, where he has saplings growing. The saplings were pretty much buried in weeds and other plants. I helped him clear his trails of weeds and brush, too.

On the day I had some refresco, later we ate lunch of lentils and rice and Jose said they were gonna go visit Nellis parents around 4, they lived on an island in the middle of the river apparently. At lunch Jose wanted to know how the housing system at Yale worked :)

After I worked some more, we went down to the shore and found Ramiro, who took us in his boat to the island. His boat is pretty janky, it has a slow leak and his motor doesn't work very well. We had to go upriver, and we barely made it because his motor kept dying. The current of the river is pretty strong in a lot of places. Finally we got there and met Nellis parents , who grow a bunch of cacao, oranges, trees, some pineapples, and they even had a guanabana tree. We picked some oranges, or mostly Alonzo picked them by climbing the tree and then threw them down to us. Nellis dad asked me about Abancay and where else I had gone, then Jose showed me this plot of trees that Nellis dad was growing. The trees were very straight and had a cool pattern on the bark, kind of like a mosaic or jigsaw puzzle. Apparently Nelli's dad had diabetes and was getting old so couldn't care for the property much anymore. Also there's some disease that plagues the cacao plants and spreads a fungus from fruit to fruit, which Jose said could wipe out half of the harvest. We went to the river and sat for a while. It looks a lot like Hawaii or Lost, because there's jungle backed by nice green mountains. Then it got dark and we prepared dinner, which was chicken soup, this delicious banana puree which they call platanito and I think something else. Maybe some roasted bananas. Jose talked to me about American fast food chains, and he said when he was in LA he'd gone to In and Out Burger and there had been a huge line. I told him I'd had a similar experience, I'd gone to In and Out and it had been packed with Asian tourists, and my fries came out cold. He asked me what Indiana's state nickname was but I couldn't remember. I told them it was funny that there was a village called Indiana in Peru, nearby above Iquitos, and there was also of course a Peru, Indiana. Of course.

After the dinner Jose and Nelli walked me across the river where it was so low that there was a little land bridge. They sent me on a path that led to the main road, and then I walked back alone about 45 min to the farm. They told me not to trust anyone, especially if they told me I was almost at Tupac and they'd take me the rest of the way :/<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG-20210711-WA0001.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
