Got up around 8, Pollix was already yelling my name. We had some breakfast of leftover split peas, the fried flaxseed breads with maple syrup, and some bananatains. Also liquid avena. The past two days José has been getting kind of mad in the mornings, yesterday he didn't eat breakfast. Today I learned that it's because he can't find anyone from Tupac to work for him, and he really needs help managing his land/farm. It's mainly because the construction company working on building the road (a highway that continues past Chazuta down the Huallaga) pays more than José can. He seems to be pretty short on money.  When he was in the US he would see and make use of day-to-day search-for-work tents, and he wishes there was that kind of large labor force here so that he could find people more easily. He said since he didn't grow up on a farm, he's still not really used to the work, which makes things even harder. He's also a perfectionist so he likes everything on the farm to be very well-kempt. Then he and Nelli told me that in 2014, while Jose was in the US and Nelli was living here, some neighbors from Tupac came in one day and started bulldozing all of their land to build a soccer field, apparently claiming it was actually their land. Jose and Nelli reported it to the police, which began a slow, painful, and corrupt legal process. The state sent Nelli a notice which gave her 8 days to appear in court with a lawyer, but she couldn't pay for that, and the letter didn't arrive until 3 days before the deadline. So they had to settle with a payment of 1000 soles per crime charged, and there were 5 charges. But the destruction that had been done to the crops merited more than 30000 soles, according to a surveyor who came to the property. The legal process ended up costing them a bunch of money too, because they kept having to go to Tarapoto or Yurimaguas to meet with people. The process also seemed to be extremely convoluted and long, because the case kept getting passed to a higher authority or a different department. And they didn't receive the payment until months later. Nelli said everything, especially the valuation of the damage, always seemed to be up to the whim of some one person who could easily be bribed, and the justice system was thus very corrupt. Anyway, some of Nelli's siblings helped her replant everything, and now the cacao plants are thriving again. Except for the pishcoisman....another funny side story of the bulldozing catastrophe was that during the neighbors' siege of the land, Jose had returned and one day found one of the neighbor's horses on the property. He took the horse and was walking it to the shore of Tupac to take to Chazuta because he wanted to get back at the neighbors. On the way he met a guy who happened to be walking a bunch of horses to Chazuta, and Jose told the man that his horse wasn't domesticated and that he needed a better domesticated one because he didn't know how to ride. So the man exchanged him the horse for a different one. Then Jose took the new horse via boat, which wasn't easy because the boats are basically like large canoes, to Chazuta and gave it to a friend, thinking that now the neighbor would never find his horse. The neighbor came to him asking for the horse but Jose told him he didn't have it, that he would have to look for it himself. Apparently the neighbor eventually did find the original horse somewhere in Chazuta, but probably with much difficulty.

They also said they wanted to make some money from the part of their property where they had a bunch of old growth forest, because the state would pay 1 Sol per well-preserved tree if it passed certain requirements, as a conservation initiative. The Peruvian government, despite being very corrupt, seems to be big on conservation. There are a lot of road signs that say things like "Lets conserve our environment." Theres also an NGO which apparently pays quite a bit monthly to those who maintain a certain amount of mature forest for carbon capture. After breakfast Nelli took me into the village because on the 20th of every month she organizes a trash/recycling cleanup day. We picked up a lot of plastic bottles that people had thrown near the river and brought them to a heap. They can sometimes be sold as recycling. Nelli kept worrying that someone would steal my water bottle/filter if I left it somewhere. Despite the fact that less than 1000 people live in the village, there are some thieves and swindlers. Pollix joined us in the trash pickup because the one day he had school his teacher never showed up. School was also only from like 9-12 it seemed, so just 3 hours per week. After the trash we went to a town meeting about various things. The main issues were that a couple people were plotting to take over some empty land in the village so they could benefit from the carbon capture profits, and then that some people weren't native to Tupac but had been there for a while, so the state was going to classify them as natives, which meant they would receive extra benefits and special status, but they actually were upset about this because they didn't want to be considered natives. Nelli said that was because they were racist. There seems to be a good amount of racism in Peru, in Abancay I noticed that sometimes there was tension between some of the Abancayans and the whiter people from Cusco. Anyway while I was talking to Nelli later I learned that there are a bunch of tribes in Peru who live in isolation further into the jungle. There's a leader of Tupac called the apu which changes every 2 years.
After the meeting we picked up Pollix and went back to the house, where we had lunch. Before lunch one of Nelli's cousin from Tarapoto named Edvin, and his family, came to visit, and he, as I found out later, used to be a pastor. Nelli told me he was known for shooting spitballs at people who fell asleep during his sermons. That definitely sounds like God's work to me. He gave us a long and repetitive sermon about how you should never say "I cant" or "I don't know" because it will inhibit you from overcoming obstacles and succeeding in life. I asked how one could learn if they never admitted they didn't know things, and he said only by observing. He was a repairman and had learned everything only by observing his dad. He told me that conviction and believing in yourself was much more important than money. Also he had gone to Italy once and when he got to the airport someone called him out for being a terrorist. He had a long beard at the time. He said they had grabbed his passport and thrown it on the ground, not believing he was from Peru. He had also tried to go Oklahoma once because he has some family there, but the US had denied him a Visa, saying there was nothing for him in Oklahoma. 
Before he left José's he offered to pick me up in Tarapoto on Saturday and bring me to his house for a meal. Hopefully I'll actually take him up on it but if there's a morning bus to Jaen I'll probably just leave. 

We had spaghetti, bananas, and fish soup for lunch. We talked about why the recycling system in America has failed and how the plastic problem might be solved, and how the global warming crisis might play out. I talked about how Yale has invested in fossil fuel companies for a long time but now students want to change that.
Dinner was some leftover spaghetti with a quinoa/evaporated milk soup, and some fried fish. I finally realized the milk in Peru has seemed so amazing because it's all canned evaporated milk. We talked about how so many families in America have multiple cars, and some even have multiple cars per person, which seemed crazy to Jose. When he was in the US he had bought a car via monthly installments to do delivery, but then gas almost doubled in price and he couldn't afford the payments anymore. The dealership didn't even want to confiscate the car, they just wanted the money, but Jose didn't have it so he left and came back to Peru. Nelli apparently would like to be rich one day and move to Canada. We debated whether being filthy rich was a good thing, especially at a young age.  I also told Jose and Nelli about some of Octa's beliefs and how he's so poor yet seems rich and has built himself a fortress out of trash, and drinks and parties all the time. I talked about how Octa had what appeared to be a human skull hanging in the treehouse and whenever we asked about it he would say "it was an idiot who was scared" and thats all he'd tell us. Then we asked his friends and they said that's what they told him too. Jose also asked me how it was to always be talking to a 40 year old, how it must be weird, but I told him it was good because younger people were harder to talk to in Spanish since they talked mostly in slang and made fun of everything. Jose and Nelli were talking about how a lot of paper comes from the Amazon area and José said it seemed like America was using less and less because of digitalization. I talked about how I had done a thorough analysis of whether a university switching to all tablets instead of paper would really do the environment any good, and found that it would probably only save a very small amount of emissions if new tablets had to be made for the university to buy. 
Jose also believes a good amount in astrological signs, so he always asks me which signs my friends and family members are and if they get mad easily, etc. 
Also today Polito was climbing into a cacao tree because he likes to climb them all the time, and a bunch of wasps stung him. He didn't cry which was pretty impressive, I've gotten stung once while picking pishcoisman and it hurts. Pollix does cry over smaller stupider things, of course. The wasps are small though, and it only hurts for a little. They like to nest on the underside of cacao leaves which is annoying. There are also annoying brown ants which often swarm on or around the cacao plants. They crawl super fast and bite.

Only 2 days left here at Jangalayacu. I've enjoyed it a lot, its very peaceful and an interesting environment. What I like most is the conversation, because Its fun and meaningful. Today for breakfast we had quinoa with evaporated milk with bread and melted cheese and a tomato salad. For lunch we had rice and lentils and some fish cakes containing flour, egg, tomato, flaxseed. Dinner was leftover lentils with some ember-cooked fish, rice, and quinoa milk. Interesting things that happened: I've been helping Jose chop firewood at the end of the day, which is pretty fun. We harvested some raw sugar cane and ate it as a snack, which was incredible. It starts off soft and sweet but as you chew it it loses its flavor and juiciness, and by the end its like you're chewing raw wood. We also toasted some cacao beans that had already been harvested, fermented, and sun-dried. We toasted up in a big pot over a fire, and had to keep stirring them constantly so they didn't burn. Apparently you can tell they're done toasting from the smell alone. Now they're ready to be peeled and ground to be made into chocolate bars or hunks. Just eating them toasted plain is delicious. 
Interesting topics of conversation: Jose and Nelli told me about some Netflix originals they're watching (they have to download them when they go to Chazuta), and we talked about how the cornfields of Indiana would be easy to rob, and how they also make a great horror movie setting. At dinner Jose told me that he found life here on the farm to be pretty hard and that he was exhausted every day. He had moved here partially because here he didn't have to worry about money as much, the farm provided them with a good amount of food and sustenance already. He said he had left home at 17 to go try to live with his uncle in Germany and study at university there, and first he had had to enroll in an intensive language school, but he ended up not being able to afford it and had to go back to Peru halfway through. He said he had enjoyed living in the US, but again he sort of ran out of money and thought it would be best to go home to his family. A taxi from the Miami airport into the city had cost him 50 dollars, which seemed like a lot to me, especially in those days. Apparently those experiences had made him worry about money and wonder about how he would make a living from a very young age, and eventually he'd decided to move here because money problems were much more stressful in Lima. Now he didn't worry about money as much, although it seems like he's not quite satisfied with the house he's built here. I told him usually it was the opposite, people didn't start worrying about money much until they moved out of their parents house.
Jose also said he was amazed by the public libraries in the US and how good the books there were. I told him about Goodwill Hunting and how the libraries in the US really are a good opportunity to learn for free. Jose showed me a book about the history of Spain, which he's really interested in. He also has this giant old encyclopaedia, in which he looked up Indianapolis, and of course the Indy 500 was mentioned so we talked about that. I explained to him that we have counties but also townships. Even though I don't really understand why the townships have such weird shapes. 
A Dutch WWOOFer is coming on Saturday right after I leave, and it sounds like Jose's brother is coming Friday. The wwoofer is a strict vegan, which Jose and Nelli are dreading.<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG_20210712_114142.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
