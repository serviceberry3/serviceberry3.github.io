The last post was from Tue, by the way. We drove through the Sechura, where every day the weather is the same: cloudy in the morning and then clear for the rest of the day, with the temp reaching around 85-90, but very dry. As far as I could remember, this was my first time in an official desert. When I got to Piura, Giancarlos met me at the stop and we went to his house in a mototaxi. (So in the end, it seemed like mototaxis were a thing everywhere in Peru except the south, where all the taxis were Toyota station wagons.) Unfortunately the achiote that was in the burlap bag had leaked and neither of us realized it, so it completely stained Giancarlos' shorts and hands when he took the sack to the taxi. I thought it was blood at first.


His place is really nice, and he lives with his whole family, including his uncle and his sister's family, although they kind of have a separate apartment upstairs. I had a whole room to myself. Still no hot water though. No one has that. Although the hotel we stayed in in Cusco did have some. 


For dinner we made chaufa, a Peruvian-Chinese fried rice dish. We ate with the whole fam. We also made a juice from papaya and guanabana, with fresh honey from the desert farm and algorrobina as sweeteners. We ate some of the sweet lemons that I brought from Huaquillo, which are lemons, but sweet. Although not very sweet. They're kind of flavorless. 


After dinner Giancarlos told me a bunch of stories about his couchsurfing experiences. He's what's called a Couchsurfing ambassador of Peru, which means he sort of supervises all of the Couchsurfing in Peru and answers people's questions/advises. He also doesnt have to pay for the membership. Couchsurfing used to be free but just recently they started charging. It seems like Couchsurfing is pretty much his life. He's hosted an insane amount of people. When the pandemic hit he was traveling in Peru with a few Europeans and an American he had hosted in Piura. They were in Moyobamba, near Tarapoto, and ended up getting stuck there in the hostel for two months because of quarantine. It seemed like they mostly just cooked and played a card game called Cambio which a German guy had taught him. Giancarlos is a civil engineer and has a master's degree, but he stopped working recently because he wanted to change his lifestyle. In the past he's mostly supervised construction jobs, including one resort project where he got to live right on the beach near Piura for a while. He also worked in Lima for a couple years and has an apartment there. He told me some about a Couchsurfing trip he'd done in South Africa, where he'd rented a car with some couchsurfers he'd met and then they did a safari by driving behind an actual safari tour company. Then I told him about My Octopus Teacher, which he hadn't heard of. 


That night I finally got 10 hours of sleep, and it felt amazing. The next morning we made more papaya juice for breakfast and also had this amazing buttery bread and some cookies with Huaquillo coffee and chocolate natillas (custard, but was more like caramel). After that we went to the family's desert farm with Gian's brother Mauricio, who's 19 but has a slight developmental disability. Gian calls Mauricio Gordo because he's chubby. The farm is just outside Piura but seems like it's in the middle of nowhere in the desert. There I met Gian's parents, who were very warm and welcoming. The farm isn't much of a farm because it's hard to grow things in the desert. They mainly raise animals to sell. They have a lot: various types of big turkeys, ducks, chickens, pigeons. But my favorite was the birds. They have some súper exotic, colorful birds, including two different types of parrots, which speak Spanish!! They mostly say nonsense. And they didn't speak very often. I also loved the parrots because they're not scared of humans at all, and they cuddled all the time despite being different shapes and sizes. They also ate like humans, by raising food with their claws to their mouths. Or at least one did that, and then fed his friend. The birds really fascinated me. The family also has some more in their house. 


My stay on the farm was great, a lot of it was just relaxing in the hammock and talking to Giancarlos. I barely did anything, because there's not much to do besides feed the animals. Gian also doesnt like to work at all after the sun comes out because its too hot. It didn't feel that hot to me, though, probably because of the low humidity. They do have some plants on the farm, mostly desert trees that they planted: orange, algorrobo, moringa, sapote, and neem. They have a lot of prickly pear cacti, San Pedro, 
(a cactus which contains the hallucinogen mescaline and is cooked for shamanistic ceremonies), and are planting some tamarind trees. There's also a small vegetable garden: lettuce, tomatoes, beets. I help feed and water the animals, plant tamarinds, and remove some big bushes that are stealing water from the trees. 


For meals we cooked quinoa risotto, rice and lentils with a pepper, onion, and aji chile salad, sometimes fried eggs for breakfast (fresh from the hens). Thurs morning I made pancakes, although there was just flour, water, sugar, and eggs, so they were very dense. We topped them with a fruit salad of papaya, watermelon, banana, honey, and something which in Peru is known as mango ciruelo, it looks like it's called 
yellow mombin in English. The mombin was my favorite fruit I've tried I Perú, although guanabana is a close second. It's sweet buy tangy. Gian's uncle does most of the bee management and one day he brought two bottles of fresh honey (different types/colors) and the watermelon to the farm. 


 On Thursday we also made rompope, a cocktail. You just heavily whip a bunch of egg whites and then add the yolks back in with sugar, then mix until everything has dissolved and is smooth and creamy. Then you add rum, or in our case we added some of what's called aguardiente, which is basically the same as caña and rum. Said aguardiente was made at the Huaquillo coffee farm and was extremely potent. It seemed over 40% alcohol content. I loved the rompope but would have loved it even more without the alcohol :) Also Giancarlos was insanely fast at whipping egg whites by hand. He was like a machine. When he was done mine were only like half-whipped.


They have 7 doges at the farm, all of which are pretty yung and crazy. Any time someone opens the door and comes out of the house for the first time in the morning, they go crazy. Any time a car or person approaches the property, they go crazy. Any time they think someone is about to go feed the animals or tend to the tree farm, they go crazy. One of them is a Peruvian Inca Orchid, a hairless black dog which really creeped me out. Petting it is disturbing. 


The two nights I stayed at the farm we played cambio, the card game, which Giancarlos taught me, and drank pure aguardiente. Afterwards Gian would tell me these insane stories about his San Pedro experiences. 


Now it's time for the juicy part. First of all, he told me about the shamans in the north of Peru, who often conduct their San Pedro ceremonies at these special lakes, each lake supposedly being appropriate for a certain problem the San Pedro recipients were having in their lives. He also said the real shamans never charge people for the ceremonies, because that would be impure. Also he said the shamans invoked both the Catholic God and saints, and the Peruvian pachamama (mother Earth) to create an interestingly blended ceremony. Other than that the details he told me about the ceremonies were pretty much what Manuel in Tarapoto had told me. He did say that San Pedro sometimes doesn't affect people at all, and that it only works if you believe in the San Pedro, the shamanism, pachamama, and the whole deal. Apparently you can tell the Pedro is doing it's job if you're burping up or farting a lot of gas. Gian also always does the San Pedro in the desert, with his mom nearby as his guardian. It seems like he's mostly done it with couchsurfers.
Gian would always tell me his hallucination experiences after we'd done some damage to the bottle of moonshine, so I don't remember them super well, but I'll do my best. 
The first one he told me was from just a week ago, when he took San Pedro with an Italian Couchsurfer named Nico. Gian had been sitting near the house and saw one of the tuna cactus plants, and each of the cactus leaves turned into a little talking face that had its own unique features and expression. Apparently Nico saw the exact same thing and they stared at the cactus for 15 minutes trying to figure out what the faces were saying.


Another time he was confronted by a spirit that told him his mom would die on April 30th. It had been the 24th or something. Afterwards Gian told his mom that something had told him someone was going to die (no one specifically), and they talked to his uncle (the one who brought the honey), who's pretty much a shaman. He advised Giancarlos and the rest of the family to be really cautious for the next couple of weeks. Sure enough, one of the family's close friends, who was like a second mother to Mauricio, had contracted COVID, and on the 30th she suffocated and died. 


Another time, recently, Gian drank the San Pedro broth with a German Couchsurfer. The guy, Pascal, got naked after he took the Pedro and lay in the sand for a long time. At some point Gian had a vision of Pascal in a fancy building wearing a white shirt and beige pants. He didn't tell Pascal about the vision, but a couple weeks later Pascal got married to an Ethiopian woman in a church and sent Giancarlos a picture, in which he was wearing said outfit. (That is a pretty normal outfit, but not really for a groom.) 


Also recently, a Couchsurfer from Australia came to the desert farm who had just broken up with his girlfriend and was looking for a lot of answers in his life. He and Giancarlos wandered the desert a little and found a log, which, after Gian stared at it for a while, transformed into an arm and hand. The arm had a tattoo, and after describing it to the Australian they realized it was his ex-girlfriend's arm. 


While with Pascal Gian had seen a man standing in the doorway of the house, and Pascal had seen it too. Gian also always saw another man at the gate of the farm who seemed to be some kind of guardian. Pascal hadn't seen it at first and walked towards the gate to take a closer look, but then one of the dogs stood up and pushed Pascal back as if he was telling him not to go over there.


So the crazy part is that everyone seems to see the same things during the San Pedro sessions. The stories are still pretty vague, but I'm now at 70% believing Peruvian shamanism is real. 


Gian also told me about this time he and his cousin went down to the South of Peru to this shaman's house to do a San Pedro ceremony, and then the shaman turned out to be a brujo malero, or someone who uses their shamanistic abilities for wicked ends. Basically a witch. Anyway, I think someone had hired the guy to perform a voodoo-style murder, and while Gian and his cousin were on the San Pedro, the brujo all of a sudden filled a sack with some clothes and fabrics and said they had to leave and drive somewhere to do something. Everyone got in the truck and they drove to a mountaintop, where the shaman began stabbing the bag repeatedly. Gian saw something writhing painfully in the bag, and it made him extremely uncomfortable. Later that night, he and his cousin were in bed when they both felt something brush against their backs and then start to squeeze them really hard. They both screamed and ran outside. Then, recently at the desert farm, Gian went out to pee in the middle of the night (this time he hadn't even taken San Pedro) when something seemed to creep up behind him and whisper, "Do you remember me from December 2017?" And December 2017 had been when they were staying at the shaman's house in the southern sierra. 


Yeah, so those stories were pretty entertaining, especially because Gian told me them at night and outside. He said he would never spend a night here alone, because there were too many spirits and scary things around. He said San Pedro reveals that every little piece of nature in your surroundings, and every plant, is actually a living, breathing, speaking entity. He also says its important to cleanse and prepare your body for about a week or a few days before you take the San Pedro, like you should eat a light diet low in saturated fat and sugar. Supposedly Ayahuasca clinics also do that. 


Nico left shortly before I arrived. He's doing a walking trip through South America, walking along the coast and trying to make it down through Chile. Hes going to try to do the Choqueqirao->Machu Picchu hike, and Gian will try to join him for that.


On a property nearby the desert farm a horde of squatters had taken over some abandoned terrain, and the police kept coming to kick them out.

Gian would like to visit the West of the US, like all the national parks and such. He has no interest in going to Miami or Florida in general. I told him Florida might be the craziest state and told about the huge illegal horse meat Industry there which came about because of the large Cuban immigrant population. The Cubans eat horse a lot. I told him how there were lots of farms in rural Florida that abused the horses terribly, so this vigilante activist Richard Couto started trespassing on the farms and recording evidence of the abuse, probably risking his life many times in the process. Now all of the crazy Floridans are hunting him and want to kill him, so he has to have a large bodyguard escort.

Friday morning we ate some fried bread, fruit salad, and amazing coffee (yes, I actually started drinking coffee every day in Perú, which is dangerous) for breakfast. Then we switched placed with Gian's parents yet again, and Mauricio again came for just the taxi ride. At Gian's house he helped me print/fill out all the documents I needed to enter the US, then he took me for a tour of Piura! Piura was my favorite city of Peru, because it had a lot of nice streets and parks but isnt massive and suspicious like Lima. Every city in Perú has a Plaza de Armas, and Piura's is especially nice. Gian had kept telling me how Piura had the best ceviche in Perú because it was on the coast. We went to his favorite place, a highly-praised hole in the wall. There was no sign in the front or anything, but people were lining up for it. They had closed the inside for COVID, you just order through the window and can also watch them make it through the window. Its just lemon, onion, salt, and the raw whitefish. Served with sweet potato, toasted corn, and some white beans, on a bed of lettuce. It was incredible. When I told Gian I had eaten ceviche in Abancay he looked like he was gonna vomit. The ceviche there was definitely a lot tougher, over"cooked." Theh probably because the fish wasn't as fresh. Anyway, this was real ceviche, Giancarlos told me.

Then we went to get cremoladas, which is like a slushie. In Piura they have a ton of exotic fruit flavors, like tamarind, algorrobina, guanabana, mango ciruelo, etc. I got tamarindo, it was tangy and refreshing! Then we went back to Gian's house, and shockingly ate lunch there. The ceviche wasnt lunch, it was ceviche, he said. 

That's pretty much where my trip ended :'''( I'm about to land in NYC. 

A few more interesting things. I barely saw any smokers in Perú, except some people who smoked a couple cigarettes at La casa del árbol. Gian said that was partly because of the cost, and also people generally gambled instead of smoked.

Also, Víctor's and José's families never drank alcohol, it seemed. 

Giancarlo's dad's family is originally Lebanese, and his mom's family is from near Huancabamba. He told me that there were a lot of people who lived north of Piura who had much darker skin and talked differently, because they had been able to preserve their native culture pretty well. Gian himself was really easy to understand and agreed that at Huaquillo they had a thick accent. He also said Mauricio had a little bit of the northern Piura accent because he hung out with people of more native descent in the neighborhood. The accent is sort of more melodic and the people up there tend to exaggerate more with superlatives, like ricississimo (soo delicious). 

Giancarlos also said Piura was the first Peruvian town taken over by the Spanish, although at that time Piura had been in a different spot slightly further north. Today the original village remains and oddly has a giant European-style plaza in the center. In the center of Piura stands a big statue of Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador, which Gian thinks is the last one standing in Peru. The others have all been taken down for obvious reasons. 

There was a 4.1 earthquake centered right near Piura while we were at the desert farm, but neither of us felt it. Usually there are a lot of what are called replicas after quakes of that size, where the plates still make small shifts as they settle. For example, after the big Piura quake that happened while I was at Huaquillo, there were some 8 smaller ones the night and morning after. So Gian expected I would feel some replicas in the desert that night, but nothing :/. 

Giancarlos is also very anti-Pedro Castillo. He said he thinks Castillo has no political experience and that it's very scary that he's in office. For the duration of his term, Peru would be in a precarious position, just waiting to collapse. Interesting because his relatives from Huaquillo do support Castillo. City vs countryside. 

In 1998 the El Niño current oscillation event hit Piura hard, causing the Piura river (which goes through the city) to flood so much that it collapsed a big bridge and killed some people. Now there's a memorial before the bridge listing the names of those who died. 

Gian also taught me a ton of Spanish, including a lot of new Peruvian slang/expressions. Unfortunately most of Peruvian slang is unique to Perú or at least to South America, so I don't know how useful it will be in the future. But it's fun to know. Mexico, for example, has their own totally different slang. I also had a lot of unresolved questions about Peruvian Spanish that I asked Gian, like for example why people use the word "vuelta" so much (especially in the North) and what it meant besides a turn or a return trip. Apparently it's just another way to say "de nuevo," or "again." 

This trip was incredible, it definitely made me think differently about how I live, about the United States in general, about how people view nature as a spiritual force, and about how much I take for granted in the US. Learned a ton of Spanish and a lot about Peruvian culture.<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG-20210806-WA0004.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
