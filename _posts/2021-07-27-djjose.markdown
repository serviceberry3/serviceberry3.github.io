Woke up and it was pouring rain. Waited till like 930, Jose and Nelli still weren't back from the island.
Jose's dad made me breakfast of leftover lentils and rice, some cocoa, fried yucca, and scrambled eggs. With some cocona refresco too. Cocona is a small yellow fruit they grow, sort of tomato-like. He asked me what I usually ate for breakfast and lunch. He told me that the water from the tap was "agua viva," whereas boiled water was "agua muerta," but I drink the agua viva because I have a filter. 
After that I went to work in the cacao orchard. The sun had come back out and it was super hot.
Soon Jose, Nelli, and the boys returned. Jose's dad brought a Bluetooth speaker which I use while I'm working. A lot of the time Pollix comes to help me find the pishcoisman, he's extremely energetic and talktative (6 yrs old) and can find the plants really fast. He's also a good climber. Usually he just rides his bike around the farm, the tires are completely deflated. 
At lunch I told José and his dad about the voting system in the US, and how the electoral college works, and how dumb it is, and how Trump only won by the college. 
Before dinner Don Jose took me into the village to the house of Nelli's cousin, who's a Baker. He was making these sort of donut-like desserts which are made from sweet potato flour (deep-fried rings). Don Jose bought us two portions which we ate there, topped with cane syrup that apparently also contained some cacao. We ate it with this interesting local wine, unlike any wine I'd had. It was sweet and served cold. Nelli's cousin called Jose "Don Jose," that's where I first heard Don used. He called me Joven Noah (Yung Noah). He asked me what I thought of the region. Don Jose bought a bunch more of the picarones to bring home for dessert. What I like is that in Peru you can often ask for a portion of X soles, for example you can say you want 2 soles worth of bread. After the picarones we went to visit another friend of Don José, and they served us this amazing cold drink made from barley. It was sort of like iced tea.


Dinner was rice, lentils, and banana, with hot cocoa, of course. Jose, Nelli and Don Jose talked about techniques for growing peanuts well. Apparently they've grown a few plants but haven't had a lot of luck. Supposedly the peanut originated in Peru, according to some archaeological evidence. I think it was some collar they found from the Incan period which depicted peanuts. How stylish. We ate the donuts (picarones) for dessert with some of my maple syrup.

 I've tried some plain dried cacao beans and they're really good. To get from the raw fruit to the sellable beans, the beans are removed from the shell and then sit in a bag for about 6 days to ferment, during which they sort of cook and become brown. Then they dry in the sun for a few days. 

After dinner Jose got out his laptop and showed me all the music he had downloaded, which was a lot. A lot of classic rock and some Outkast songs. Also some Tupac, which was funny because the village is called Tupac Amaru. He said he always listens to the same songs over and over, which I also do. He also had some crazy psychedelic animated music videos downloaded, and trailers for a bunch of movies like Pulp Fiction, There Will Be Blood, Catch Me If You Can, and others. He had some full TV episodes downloaded, too. And he uses Netflix on his phone to download stuff to watch at the farm.

Got up around 7. This was Jose's dad's last day visiting, on Sat he would return to Lima by bus (about 30 hours). We had some fried eggs, liquid avena, cocoa, and banana for breakfast.

I helped Jose Sr install a switch for the kitchen light. 
Then I worked in the pishcoisman, Pollix helped me a little but always gets tired fast. There were a lot of dark rainclouds on the horizon but they just seemed to hover there for hours, as usual.

Lunch was spaghetti with a homemade marinara sauce. Also some baked bananas. Never forget the bananas. 

I worked for about another hour, Jose said we were gonna go to this little pool on the river around 4. But at 4 it started raining, so we postponed it. It apparently rains here about 48% of the time.

Pollix and I climbed some trees in the yard to remove pishcoisman. One of them is this tree with fruits that contain seeds coated in a red pigment which is literally like paint. It's also edible, sometimes they use it to color their food for fun and add some flavor too. It has a pretty bitter flavor. Pollix ended up breaking a big branch of that tree and falling, then he went to hide from his parents. 

For dinner I made a fire in the wood stove they have, and we made hot cocoa, then roasted pollo and some small catfish over las brasas. Jose's dad had brought the catfish from Tupac, and they were still partially alive.
At dinner Jose Andres, Nelli and Jose Sr talked about some issues they were having with a neighbor who apparently didn't rightfully own their land. After dinner we talked about the next wwoofing I was going to, a coffee farm, and how I could get there. Apparently they think it might be a lot of work because its harvest season, and that it would be hot and rainy. But they thought coffee was pretty cool. They think the bus ride from Jaen might be 8 or 10 hours. 
We talked about the different regions of Spain I'd visited, how there are a lot of different dialects there and Euskera is pretty much as hard to learn as Quechua because its completely unrelated to Spanish.
We made a cocktail with whiskey, algarrobina (a syrup that seemed exactly like molasses but comes from a tree), and I think banana, to celebrate Big Jose's departure. It was sort of like an alcoholic milkshake or chunky monkey.  

Apparently yellow fever is indeed real here, because Nelli said some neighbors got it.

Today around 1 pm Jose, Alonzo, Nelli, and Pollix got back. They'd waited hours for a boat from Chazuta before one arrived. They brought back some lunch: a spicy chicken stew which had been made in honor of someone who had died, roasted chicken, and yucca. We ate it with some rice I had been making. Apparently Las Flores hostal, where I'd found out the owner knew Jose, was no longer where they stayed, because Jose had once stayed there and left extremely early in the morning without letting the owner know beforehand, and he'd also left some shorts behind which caused a bunch of confusion :) Apparently the owner had thought the early departure to be rude and had wasted time trying to figure out whom the shorts belonged to. While in Chazuta Jose had remembered to look up Indiana's state nickname, and he found Crossroads of America, which I had thought wasn't the official nickname, but just some other informal label. Now I see that the official nickname is "The Hoosier State," which I'd forgotten. 

Apparently summer vacation for school here is in December and January, and the kids currently only go to school once a week because of COVID. Nelli said education here is very basic and the quality is pretty bad, and that almost everything is left to the parents. 

It rained in the afternoon, then around 430 Jose took me to this pool on the Quebrada River. Everything was really muddy and I went barefoot. We had to wade through a creek at one point and saw a crab. I told Jose that everything here looks like the set of Lost, and he told me about a time he was on the rock above the pool and slipped and started to fall but them something mysterious pulled him back. I told him that was even more like Lost. He told me about some crazy plane crash in the 60s or 80s in the mountains where some people actually had to survive in the woods for a while. I think the flight was from Uruguay to Chile or something. Uruguay Air Force flight 571. On the way back I told José how I would like to have my own farm one day because I wanted to know where all of my food came from. It was too easy to become preoccupied by your job in the city and end up buying fast or processed food or buying produce at supermarkets without knowing the story behind it. I feared that that produce came from exploitation or farms where the workers were underpaid. It was also just so suspicious how all the produce at big supermarkets always looked perfect, and almost fake. 

When we got back I talked to José about what he had done when he lived in the US and Canada. He'd lived for a few years with a relative in North Hollywood and had worked in some restaurants and delivering pizzas to some mansions in the Hollywood hills. He'd pretty much just gone to the US hoping to make more money. He'd also lived in Queens for a few months and then on Long Island, then in Miami. When he first arrived he spoke little English and the restaurant told him they had one spot available for a dishwasher, but he heard it as DJ. He said, "I don't know much about that, but I can try." 

We listened to some Pink Floyd and Rolling Stones, and some long news reels he had downloaded about when Del Shanmon killed himself - a bunch of news reports that all repeated the exact same thing. For dinner we had some fish soup, banana, homemade flaxseed bread with cheese, and popcorn. They call the cheese chicles because it has the texture of chewing gum. I talked some with José about The Matrix, he said he'd take the red pill which is respect. I told him about some crazy villages in the world, like one that exists solely underground in the Australian desert, and one that exists in just one apartment building in the Alaskan freezer.
Right before dinner Nelli found out Pollix had broken the tree branch and gave him a spanking.<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG_20210716_100147.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
