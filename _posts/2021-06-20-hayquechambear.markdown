La casa del árbol is a very interesting and happening place. All of the kids who live in the neighborhood come to play in/around the treehouse every day. They're really curious and incredibly eager to learn English, and they forget our names a lot! They already are very independent--siblings care for each other, and they keep themselves occupied really well and don't fight much, it's really impressive. They often ask to borrow our phones to watch TikTok. We try to teach them some English and play games with them. They love climbing around the treehouse like little monkeys, there's an acrobatics web that they swing on a lot. The treehouse is like a giant playground.
The past couple days we've been waking up whenever, then eating breakfast with Octa, which is usually some leftovers, fruits, smoothies, potatoes, or avocado on bread. We often eat on the top level of the tree house, which has amazing views (see pic). At some point we work for a few hours in the garden area, where some veggies like lettuces and squash are growing. Right now we're turning a grassy hill into a terrace so that we can plant more veggies. 
The treehouse is definitely the most impressive construction project I've seen, because the whole thing is made from reused materials. We used tires, mud, and an old computer monitor to build a wall for the terrace. Most of the tables are TV screens. There are two bathrooms with working plumbing, and plenty of lights. Water comes from a nearby river. The treehouse is constructed in an avocado tree and some other trees, and there's a surplus of ripe avocados falling everywhere around the house now. They're delicious. The skin is thinner than avocados I've seen in America. Octa also made a pretty cool speaker system for the house which works with Bluetooth. There are also a lot of places to sleep, although the neighbor has a loud rooster which likes to sing all night for some reason. 
Usually we have a large meal in the afternoon after working. It's often chicken sauteed with lemon, garlic, and salt, with a salad of avocado, tomato, and onion. Sometimes we have pofatoes, yuka, and some other sweet potato-like vegetable which I still can't figure out. We also sometimes have rice and raw milk which has an amazing flavor. 
The tree house is sort of like an open community center. The people from the neighborhood are often around and sometimes help us work. Octa's mom also lives in part of the tree house. On Friday some of Octa's friends came to hang out for a while. We chatted a bunch about music preferences and Peru, and even went to dance in a little designated disco room that Octa set aside. Salsa dancing is pretty popular in Peru.
Thus began the shenanigans of the weekend. It turns out the treehouse sort of turns into a bar on weekend nights. On Saturday we worked on the terrace some, and Octa's brother Guillermo, whos a fercho in Cusco, came, along with some of Octa's nieces and nephews. Some group of filmmakers from Lima also came to check out la casa and interview Octa, it sounded like they mostly made videos about skating. Saturday night was pretty crazy because the tree house was full of people drinking and talking. It was also really fun. We talked to Guillermo and Octa for a while, they told us a lot about corruption in Peru, how people who are imprisoned don't really get a trial and getting out always just comes down to money. They also talked a lot about Sendero Luminoso, a supposed "terrorist group" in Peru which they said was really just a group of political outcasts that escalated into chaos because of fear, reckless police moves, and huge confusion about who even was the enemy. Guillermo is really talkative and outgoing, he told us about how he leads tourists on impromptu tours in Cusco and he also brought a drink called chicha de jora, a traditional Incan drink made of fermented corn. It tasted a lot like kombucha. He said it would upset our stomachs and that it cleansed the prostate. 
After we hung out for a while and wAtched many people come into la casa, Octa's friends from Friday came with a car at around 9 and we all drove a while to a place called Santo Tomas. It's a huge gorge/canyon with hot springs. Octa only goes at night because you technically aren't allowed to camp or enter after a certain hour. We lugged a ton of equipment, food, and kindling in the moonlight about a mile to the springs, then made a huge fire and cooked dinner. We bathed and ate in the springs for most of the night, using a floating tray that Octa brought. The water was nice and warm, and the stars were nice. You could see the silhouette of the giant opposing face of the canyon in the moonlight. Octa slept in the pool and I slept on the ledge.
This morning we walked around the canyon a little and then drove back to the casa, where we prepared a giant roast for Father's Day. It was basically chincharrón. Octa's mom helped prepare it. We ate it with potatoes and a spicy green sauce. We poured beer inside the grill to cook it. We ate with Octa's mom, niece, and two nephews, who wanted to know all about American pop culture and English. 
Octa is very clever, resourceful, and generous. Money obviously doesn't mean anything to him, and he's basically a mom to all of the kids in the neighborhood. He's really adventurous, likes to climb, and believes life is just a recess from death. He's definitely created something one-of-a-kind. <br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG_20210620_213508_01.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
