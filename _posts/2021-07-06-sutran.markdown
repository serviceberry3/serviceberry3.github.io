I went to sleep after writing the last blog post and woke up to Octa's voice in the kitchen :) He made it over the snow cap and got down to the highway as it was getting dark, but he couldn't find any cars going to Kiuñalla, so he had to hitch a ride back to Abancay. He told us about his trip over the nevado, how the snow was very hard and tightly packed, and how the mountain always taught him so much, how he loved finding new paths and testing the mountain, going right and then left and learning where was good to step. He said as he descended, some farmer thought he was trying to steal cows and sent hunting dogs after him for a second. Apparently the last glimmer of sunlight guided him off the mountaintop...
I forgot to add a few things to the last post. Some days ago a couple gangster friends of Octa's came to la casa, and one had been in jail for eight years. I couldn't understand anything he said because he only spoke in slang. But I do remember him saying "jail is the world's greatest university." He also told us about inflation in jail, like how getting a cell phone costs a fortune. Apparently he had also worked collecting rocks near the Nazca lines and selling them for crazy prices. I had never heard of the Nazca lines, so we talked about how they might have been made. That reminded Octa of a story: when the pandemic hit, more excavation commenced at.Choqueqirao (a lesser-known Machu Picchu) because it closed to.visitors for some time. (Apparently Choqueqirao is estimated to be only 30-40% uncovered.) At some point the diggers working there found a cloak made of solid gold, and a fight broke out. One man ran off with the poncho and supposedly no one knows where he is now. 
Octa also seems to believe in reincarnation of some sort. He's really into fossils, and he told us that when he sees a fossil of a snail, for example, he hopes/feels like he was that snail in a past life. "You wish you were once a snail?" I asked him. And yes, he really does!
Octa also really wants to raise animals when he lives in Ampay.
I recently realized Oca is also called New Zealand yam. Octa's mom often buys a ton and cooks them to sell. They're sweet and delicious. The other day she had what seemed like 2 400 pound bags delivered, and we helped spread.them all out on the ground on a neighbor's property to dry in the sun, because that makes them sweeter. We had to pass them over a wall first, little by little, using some fabric sheets. 
Today Octa's friend John took us and his girlfriend to a really nice mirador above Abancay. When we got close to the viewpoint, something funny happened. Apparently there's some authority in Peru called SUTRAN, which enforces ground transportation rules. They occasionally post some officers on the highway to randomly stop cars and check for appropriate license and documentation, and if they don't find it, they remove your license plates and fine you. So we got close to the checkpoint (very close, within a 1 minute walk and in plain sight of the officers), and there on the side of the road many cars were parked and people were just standing there waiting for the officers to leave. Some people were even walking along the highway because they couldn't risk driving through. A few cars were waiting until a semi came through and then hugging the back of the truck so that they could get past the officers without being stopped. John didn't have his license with him, but Ian did, so Ian drove through the checkpoint (manual transmission, so it was pretty rough). At the mirador some people were building something and started fighting viciously for some.reason. It seemed like an odd place to argue.
Tonight some of Octa's friends came over and we watched the end of the Peru-Brazil soccer game. Then we talked a bunch about rock bands, how they're pronounced in English, and watched a lot of videos of bands that looked like they were from the 80s. We also watched a recording of a Tomorrowland rave, which was crazy. 

We're leaving in 30 min for Choqueqirao, unfortunately we didn't make it to Kiuñalla :( Octa decided not to go because he couldn't find a ride. He kept telling us that its a great community and wed love the people there,  and that he wants to start some WWOOFing projects there. John and some others are going to Choqueqirao and invited us to tag along. Can't wait!
