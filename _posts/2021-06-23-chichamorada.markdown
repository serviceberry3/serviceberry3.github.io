On Monday and Tuesday we didn't do any work, mostly just hung around the treehouse and played with the kids. Been eating lots of potatoes, rice, yucca, and salads of avocado, tomato, and onion. Oh did I mention avocadoes? On Monday night some of Octa's friends from Cusco (whom he met because he's into downhill mountain biking) came to stay and bike, and they brought some food from a restaurant. Octa's cousin and his cousin's brother-in-law were also here. His cousin is here a lot drinking and spending the night because his wife left him :(. He's always very emotional. All of said guests were very talkative. The brother in law told us that people here joke about how they pray for the US dollar not to become stronger. We talked to the mountain bikers for a while about the festivals about to begin in Cusco, which they said originate from a day when slaves were allowed to do whatever they want, but now the festivals have grown into something much bigger and more dragged out for various reasons. It sounded like it gets pretty crazy in the streets of Cusco these days. They also taught us that in Peru adding 'azo' to pretty much any word gives it emphasis. They spoke good English and said English is taught really well in Cusco because tourism is huge there.
Later in the night more of Octa's friends came to party, the ones who had gone with us to Santo Tomas. One of them, John, was mixing drinks with Pisco, passionfruit, lemon, and some other juice I think. Octa's signature drink is hibiscus, coca leaves, anise, water, and caña pura. We stayed up most of the night talking about Peruvian slang, traveling, Santo Tomas, and going camping again. Octa spoke some good English and some Italian with one of his friends. (He lived in Italy for eight months). 
Yesterday we helped a little to remove some grass and vines from a couple plants. We also helped Octa's mom make chicha morada, a delicious drink made by boiling purple corn for a long time. We removed the raw corn from the cobs and cut the cobs open to boil as well. Last night Octa's cousin came again with a friend to buy beers, and we sat with them for a few hours. His friend had a mountain of questions for us. He wanted to know all about the cultural differences between Americans, Peruvians, and Europeans. Octa's cousin had said some nights ago that gringos are cold and don't feel anything. Anyway, the friend also wanted to know all about what we study, our life dreams, why we came to Peru, whether he should invest in cryptocurrency and what it even is, whether we believe in gods or the devil, and more. He said he can tell gods exist when he feels the delicious flavor of a ripe fruit hit is tongue. Both Octa's cousin and his friend spent the night. They're really fun, his cousin is very animated and a good actor.
Today with breakfast we had an amazing drink that Octa's mom made. It turned out to be just flour, sugar, and hot water, which I thought was crazy. We helped clean leaves and debris off the roof of the first level of the treehouse. His mom fell onto the roof and it almost collapsed. Octa told us some stories of when some people, including himself, had fallen from the treehouse, but luckily they were all fine. Then we helped Octa clean and fix up the top level of the treehouse. He showed us some old videos of him mountain biking. They had rigged a camera on a sort of zip line to get a professional shot. I played my music on the tree house's speaker system and Octa really liked it, but his mom didn't. She's apparently really sensative to noise, so she also doesn't like that the children come here to play all day. She usually stays in her room and watches TV. Anway one of the tables in the treehouse is made out of a TV, and Octa was able to connect the TV speaker to the rest of the speaker system, which was cool. For lunch today we had a squash stew that Octa's mom made. After lunch I walked to the Plaza de Armas downtown, which was beautiful. I finally realized that all of Abancay is built on a giant hill. I helped Octa bring a bunch of wood and beams from a warehouse to the treehouse using a wheelbarrow so that we could repair a broken bridge.
The kids always ask us to give them our phones to play on or for making TikToks, so now "me prestas tu celular?" is a big joke for us. We say it back to them all the time, and I think only one of the kids has realized that we're joking. The kids have apparently become pretty addicted to the phones now, which is bad because they've started fighting over them.
Coco is an older man who lives near the treehouse and moved here from Lima because of COVID. He lives here with some family, who apparently make fun of him because he's a little slow. He helps around the treehouse all the time, and he's really kind. 
Princesa is the main dog who lives in the treehouse, there are also a couple cats, one of which has one green and one blue eye. There's a swarm of dogs that live in the  neighborhood, and there are often a few in the treehouse.
Octa always has plenty of stories to tell, and he tells them pretty beautifully. A while ago he base jumped off a tall bridge near Santo Tomas into the river, and he described the jump as feeling as though he was slowly flashing back his entire life, then when he sank into the water it was like he was inside his mother's womb  again, and when he came to the surface it was like he was emerging into the world anew. 
He's helping us plan a trip to Kiuñalla, a community near Choqueqirao where he knows a lot of people. He exchanges work and projects with them, a concept/system called ayni.<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG_20210620_095049.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
