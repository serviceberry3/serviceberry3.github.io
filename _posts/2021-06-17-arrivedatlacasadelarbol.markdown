We got to Cusco early Wed morning, it was nice and crisp outside. We walked from the airport to downtown which took a while, and there were many hecklers trying to give us taxi rides near the airport. We got some Inca Kolas in the outskirts and made our way toward La Plaza de Armas. Tons of people trying to sell stuff, and some were pretty chatty. Lots of shoe shiners and people selling paintings or jewelry. We got to the plaza and soon met a nice guy who showed us where our hostel, kokopelli, was, waited for us to check in, then showed us a local restaurant and helped us order and sat with us. After he'd spent like three hours talking to us he asked us to buy some of his paintings. 
The food was good, even though the guy thought it would be weird for us or we wouldn't like it. After the restaurant we walked around Cusco some more, the cobblestone streets are narrow and full of shops and small kiosk vendors. 
Today we had breakfast at the hostel, then walked around more to some other plazas and markets. At an interesting chicharrón lunch and took the bus to Abancay at 4:00. The bus goes all the way to Lima overnight, and the highway is pretty crazy. It zigzags through the mountains. 
We got to Abancay and took a taxi to Casa del Arbol, Octa greeted us there and he's awesome, he made us this delicious drink with rum and some juice and flowers. La casa is really impressive, he's been working on it since he was seven he said. It's a three-story treehouse with bathrooms and bedrooms, and utilities. He sat and talked with us for a while about what he likes to do, a lot of backpacking and trading work for recycled materials that he can use to build things. He speaks Italian, Quechua, Spanish, and some French. He loves Choquequirao, a park with snow-capped peaks just north of Abancay. He's hoping to help build another casa at Kiuñalla, a community at Choquequirao where he said the people are really nice. He's definitely real open-minded and welcoming and already shared a lot of stories.<br><br><br><br><img src="{{ '/assets/img/IMG_20210616_110626.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" width="400" /><br><br><br><br><br><span class="text-sm">Posted from <a href="https://github.com/serviceberry3/ghub_pgs_blog_pusher" class="text-green-500">mobile companion app</a></span>
